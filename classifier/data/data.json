Families come together to celebrate, exchange gifts, play dreidel games, and enjoy special foods, particularly those cooked in oil to commemorate the miracle of the oil lasting eight days. Hanukkah serves as a reminder of the enduring spirit of freedom, the strength of community, and the power of miracles, making it a cherished and meaningful holiday for Jewish people worldwide.\r\n\r\nHanukkah Lights\r\nby Philip M. Raskin\r\n\r\nI kindled my eight little candles,\r\nMy Hanukkah candles, and lo!\r\nFair visions and dreams half-forgotten\r\nWere rising of years long ago.\r\n\r\nI musingly gazed at my candles;\r\nMeseemed in their quivering flames\r\nIn golden, in fiery letters\r\nI read the old, glorious names;\r\n\r\nThe names of our heroes immortal,\r\nThe noble, the brave, and the true;\r\nA battlefield saw I in vision,\r\nWhere many were conquered by few;\r\n\r\nAnd mute lay the Syrian army,\r\nJudea\u2019s proud foe, in the field;\r\nAnd Judas, the brave Maccabaeus,\r\nI saw in his helmet and shield.\r\n\r\nHis eyes shone like bright stars of heaven,\r\nLike music resounded his voice:\r\n\u201cBrave comrades, we fought and we conquered,\r\nNow let us in God\u2019s name rejoice!\r\n\r\n\u201cWe conquered; but know, my brave comrades,\r\nNo triumph is due to the sword;\r\nRemember our motto and watchword,\r\n\u2018For the people and towns of the Lord.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and from all the four corners\r\nAn echo repeated each word;\r\nThe woods and the mountains re-echoed:\r\n\u201cFor the people and towns of the Lord.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd swiftly the message spread, calling:\r\n\u201cJudea, Judea is free!\r\nRekindled the lamp in the Temple,\r\nRekindled each bosom with glee!\u201d How much this festival changed from the period when the poem was written (late 19th or early 20th century) to 2023.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Deep Q-Networks (DQN), as introduced by [3], are a family of deep Q-Learning algorithms where a value function is estimated for every state-action pair in the system. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find a stationary policy \u03c0 : S \u00d7 A \u2192 [0, 1] that maximizes the expected discounted sum of future rewards: J \u03c0 = E \"X\u221e t=0 \u03b3 t rt s0\u223c\u00b5, at\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|st) rt=r(st,at) st+1\u223cP(\u00b7|st,at) # . (1) Q-learning achieves this by estimating the Q-value of a greedy policy that selects the action that maximizes that Q-value, yielding the Bellman optimality equation [4]: Q(s, a) = E r(s, a) + \u03b3 max a \u2032\u2208A Q(s \u2032 , a\u2032 ) \r\ns \u2032\u223cP(s,a) , \u2200s \u2208 S, \u2200a \u2208 A . (2) To deal with large state and action spaces, the Q-value function is implemented as a neural network, and its loss function over transitions (st , at , rt , st+1) experienced in the environment is defined as follows: L(\u03b8) = E h rt + \u03b3 max a \u2032\u2208A Q(st+1,a\u2032 ;\u03b8 \u2032) \u2212 Q(st,at;\u03b8) 2 i (3) Because the target Q-value function at st+1 evolves at the same speed as the regular Q-value function, training curves can be quite unstable and prevent the agent from converging towards an optimal policy. To avoid this, a soft target update is used where the target network, with parameters \u03b8 \u2032 , is a copy of the original Q-value function, which is updated after every gradient upsate step using the rule \u03b8 \u2032 \u2190 (1\u2212\u03c4 )\u03b8 \u2032 +\u03c4\u03b8 where \u03c4 is the soft update parameter. Further instability both early on during training and after having converged to the optimal policy can happen if an agent only learns from the last step it has taken. To mitigate this, a replay buffer can be helpful. Replay buffers are filled with a set number of past recordings of actions, states and rewards. During training, a batch is sampled from the replay buffer and used to perform gradient descent steps based on the Q-value update function. In this project, both soft target updates and a replay buffer were used as they improved dramatically the performance of our agent.\r\n\r\nCan you understand what these equations are for and what are they achieving? Basically explain it to me.\r\n",

Can you summarise and just give me a heads up on the experiment?\r\nExperiments\r\nTo answer our research questions, we tested the performance of our algorithm in 3 different settings, which use different shape blindness masks. In the areas covered by the masks, the agent will use the open-loop policy to move towards the goal in the optimal amount of steps. \r\nThe first experimental setting serves as an overall benchmark and answers our first sub-question: Can our loss function train both an open-loop and a closed-loop controller to be robust to blind state masks without training on them? For this experiment, we use the left maze in Figure 4, combined with all the masks shown in the left maze in Figure 5. Since none of these masks overlap, the controller is forced to switch between both open and closed loop control. The second experimental setting answers our second and third sub-questions: How does length/frequency of blindness during evaluation affect loss and reward during testing? and How does the presence or absence of open-loop policy trajectories in the replay buffer affect robustness to temporary blindness?. It also attempts to answer our fourth sub-question: How many successive steps in the future can we use to train an open-loop policy robust to temporary blindness?. In this experiment we use the right maze in Figure 4. For multiple values of N of our proposed loss, we find out the largest number of steps for which it can use the open-loop controller reliably. We do this by starting with the first block of the optimal path being masked, then the first 2, the first 3, etc. until all blocks on the optimal path between the starting position and the goal are covered, or until the agent can no longer reliably reach the goal. The third experimental setting takes a closer look at the sub-question Can our loss function train both an open-loop and a closed-loop controller to be robust to blind state masks without training on them? by using the left maze in Figure 4, combined with the masks shown in the right maze in Figure 5. We report the relationship between the relevant hyperparameters and each individual mask, to better understand the kinds of challenges that our agents struggle most with. This can be found in the appendix.\r\nResults and Discussion Switching between closed and open-loop In this experiment we trained agents with values of N from 1 to 12 for 60.000 global steps in the left maze in Figure 4 with p set to 0.5. The optimal path for this maze is 34 steps. We evaluate whether the controller is able to switch between closed and open-loop using the left maze in Figure 5 with epsilon set to 0.05. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6. As we can see in the graph, agents that have been trained for N < 4 are not able to find the goal within the given timesteps, which might be due to the shortest masked path being 6 steps long. What is perhaps more interesting, is that while all of the others were able to reach the goal at some point, only the agent with N = 7 was able to do so in (close to) the optimal number of steps. The longest optimal path through any of the masks takes 8 steps. This means that the agent can still generalize at least somewhat to states that it has not been trained on. Overall, the Figure shows that the controller is able to successfully switch between open and closedloop to solve the masked maze, in some cases even performing optimally. However, since we only used 3 different draws to compute the statistics, the results are not statistically reliable enough.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Help me write a promotional guest post (500-650 words) about NANO Nuclear Energy, but the main focus should be on Illinois allowing new nuclear power plants. Talk about how NANO Nuclear Energy is part of this change and why it's good for the economy and the environment. Keep it easy to understand but do not make it sound like an ad. Also, include at least two links to NANO Nuclear's profiles. Here is some info on it: Illinois lawmakers have approved House Bill 2473, signaling the end of a 36-year moratorium on new nuclear power generation in the state. The legislation, passed with bipartisan support in the Senate (44-7) and the House (98-8), allows for the development of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and positions NANO Nuclear Energy as a key player in shaping the future of Illinois' energy landscape. NANO Nuclear Energy, an industry leader in innovative nuclear technology, finds itself at the forefront of this transformative shift. The company's commitment to advancing small modular reactors aligns seamlessly with the state's vision for a diverse and sustainable energy portfolio. The recently approved bill, while not completely lifting the moratorium on nuclear construction, establishes a regulatory framework for the development of SMRs. These reactors, with a capped capacity of 300 megawatts, represent a paradigm shift in the energy sector. NANO Nuclear Energy's proactive approach to SMR technology places the company ahead of the curve, making significant strides towards a cleaner and more reliable energy future. Proponents of the bill emphasize its role in ensuring a reliable transition away from fossil fuels, a crucial step in achieving Illinois' carbon-free power production goals by 2045. The legislation acknowledges the importance of SMRs in providing a stable energy supply, particularly as intermittent sources like wind and solar become integral to the state's energy mix. One of the significant advantages of SMRs is their potential to enhance Illinois' electric reliability. As traditional power sources face challenges and some power plants shut down, the need for a dependable and carbon-free energy solution becomes more pressing. NANO Nuclear Energy's dedication to small modular reactors positions the company as a catalyst for addressing these challenges and ensuring energy security. While critics express concerns about the unproven nature of SMR technology, NANO Nuclear Energy's commitment to innovation distinguishes it in the industry. The company's efforts to develop SMRs reflect a strategic approach to meeting the energy needs of the future. Moreover, the potential for SMRs to be deployed at the sites of former coal plants in Illinois, as highlighted by Sen. Sue Rezin, presents an innovative solution to repurpose existing infrastructure. This approach could eliminate the need for building new transmission lines, streamlining the integration of SMRs into the state's energy grid. NANO Nuclear Energy's forward-thinking vision aligns with the broader goals of Illinois' clean energy agenda. The company's focus on small modular reactors complements the growth of wind and solar energy, offering a diversified and resilient energy mix. While critics, including environmentalists, raise concerns about the environmental and safety implications of SMRs, proponents argue that NANO Nuclear Energy's approach prioritizes safety and regulatory oversight. The bill mandates a comprehensive study to inform the rules for regulating SMRs, underscoring a commitment to addressing potential risks. The legislative framework also empowers the Illinois Emergency Management Agency to oversee newly installed reactors, adding an extra layer of scrutiny to ensure safety standards are met. NANO Nuclear Energy's cooperation with regulatory bodies positions the company as a responsible leader in the pursuit of sustainable nuclear energy solutions.",

    "Prompt": "Cultural and religious restrictions on girls are pervasive and have been a longstanding issue in many societies around the world. These restrictions are deeply rooted in traditional beliefs, customs, and religious interpretations, and they often limit the autonomy and opportunities available to girls. \r\n\r\nIn some cultures and religious communities, arranged or forced marriages are common. Girls are often married off at a young age, sometimes against their will, and are denied the right to choose their own partners. This practice can have serious consequences for their physical and emotional well-being.\r\n\r\nFemale Genital Mutilation is a harmful cultural practice prevalent in certain communities, particularly in parts of Africa, Middle East, and Asia. It involves the partial or complete removal of a girl's external genitalia and is usually performed without her consent. It has serious health implications and violates girls' bodily integrity.\r\n\r\nStrict dress codes and modesty rules are often imposed on girls and women by many cultures and religions. These restrictions are often enforced to require the covering of their bodies, including their hair and faces, in order to adhere to perceived notions of purity and virtue.\r\n\r\nLimited access to quality education for girls is often prioritized over boys' education by some societal norms and beliefs. Their intellectual development and future opportunities can be severely hindered by this restriction.\r\n\r\nSpecific gender roles and responsibilities within the household are often assigned to females. This may entail expectations for girls to engage in domestic chores and take care of younger siblings, potentially constraining their capacity to pursue education and other interests.\r\n\r\nIn certain societies, girls may face restrictions on their mobility and freedom to travel independently. This limitation can impede their access to educational and economic opportunities and hinder their personal development. A report published by the United Nations titled Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): The Gender Snapshot 2022 indicates that it may take close to 300 years for full gender equality to be achieved.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each paragraph add the US code of law that prohibits those actions in US.

Generate notes for this text, mentioning important decisions and key events that took place.\r\nFor music data, make a separate list with details only for music.\r\nLudwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s Oppenheimer features a violin as its stylistic centrepiece, and the way this is used to both tonally represent the titular character as well as emotionally bolster the score\u2019s rather enjoyable main themes makes this soundtrack well worth a listen. The themes could have done with a bit more album time though.\r\nThe main theme for Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s Oppenheimer score comes in two parts; the first is made up of two notes, heard first on a quietly downtrodden violin \u2013 incidentally the score\u2019s instrumental centrepiece \u2013 in opening track \u201cFission\u201d. Despite its rather moody first appearance however it plays somewhat more optimistically through much of the score, perhaps to tonally represent the success and achievements of Robert J. Oppenheimer as he progresses with developing the world\u2019s first atomic bomb in the film. The second part of the main theme is then a six-note sequence that appears briefly in the background of the aforementioned track, before then playing centre stage throughout subsequent and standout cue \u201cCan You Hear The Music\u201d; it\u2019s a more heartfelt, intimate and solemn motif likely for Oppenheimer himself, and the way the theme twists and turns emotionally in this elegant two minute track as the violins get louder and faster, combined with the two-note motif from earlier reprising for several increasingly bolder and grandiose appearances on emphatic electronics, quickly gives rise to a deeply rich musical atmosphere here that\u2019s very enjoyable indeed. There\u2019s equal parts hope and optimism as there is worry and tension, and that tonal combination playing on the unusual but surprisingly effective violin/electronic instrumental mix makes G\u00f6ransson\u2019s soundtrack introduction to Oppenheimer here a pretty unique and intriguing one too. It certainly catches your ear.\r\nSo a rather interesting start for the score, and that\u2019s coming from someone who did not think highly at all of G\u00f6ransson\u2019s work for Christopher Nolan\u2019s last film TENET. \u201cA Lowly Shoe Salesman\u201d then opens with slow, gentle strings and hopeful piano notes, which continue all across the three minute cue. \u201cQuantum Mechanics\u201d then reprises the six note side of the main Oppenheimer theme on the same heartfelt violin as in \u201cCan You Hear The Music\u201d, though this time in a slightly slower manner with quiet piano notes and ethereal vocals now occupying the background. The two-note side then makes a couple of brief electronics-based reprisals before the track draws to a gentle close. A new theme is then introduced in \u201cMeeting Kitty\u201d; a quieter, more pensive piano-based motif for the titular Kitty Oppenheimer. This is naturally quite a romantic piece of music overall, with Kitty\u2019s theme getting quite an extensive debut as the track comes in at over five minutes long. The tone then turns almost malevolent in the subsequent \u201cManhattan Project\u201d, as coldy imposing electronics enter the fray as if to kick off a tense action setpiece, but the pace instead stays slow and moody with worrisome piano notes joining the music in the back half of the track. The two-note side of the main theme then reprises in \u201cAmerican Prometheus\u201d, on solemn violin notes at first before then moving over to building electronics that rise slowly in intensity.\r\nAdvertisement\r\nStrings-based tension is the tonal focus of \u201cFusion\u201d, with a worrisome pace set right off the bat as the four minute track begins. The strings then build in both volume and intensity over the course of the cue, with frenetic bursts of brass then bringing the music to a dramatic close. A rather on-edge variation on the two-note side of the main theme plays in \u201cColonel Pash\u201d, with additional, more sorrowful strings and eerily ambient electonics also joining the fray in the last few minutes of the track. The six-note side of the main theme then ominously reprises in the subsequent \u201cTheorists\u201d alongside tense electronics, with all the aforementioned instrumentation building to a particularly emphatic finishing crescendo. Worrisomely high-paced strings then open the seven minute \u201cTrinity\u201d, with the two-note side of the main theme then announcing itself on similarly tense brass. Building tension is then the tonal focus for much of the track, with increasingly high-pitched strings building to multiple crescendos. Downtrodden string plucks then occupy much of the opening two minutes of \u201cPower Stays In The Shadows\u201d, with some particularly sorrowful additional strings pulling the mood into melancholy alongside eerie vocals in the back half of the cue. Ominous atmosphere then covers the subsequent five minute \u201cThe Trial\u201d like a black cloud, with quietly morose strings and moody background electronics emphasizing this tonal shift throughout.\r\n\u201cKitty Comes To Testify\u201d reprises the lightly romantic motif for the titular character \u2013 first heard in the earlier \u201cMeeting Kitty\u201d \u2013 on those same gentle piano notes, though this then fades quickly after the cue begins in favour of more solemn string notes and quiet electronics playing the two-note section of the main theme. This solemnity then continues into the subsequent \u201cSomething More Important\u201d, with repeating, downtrodden string notes being pretty central in the final minute or so of the track. As the album overall starts to draw to a close, \u201cDestroyer Of Worlds\u201d then ties for Standout Cue with the earlier \u201cCan You Hear The Music\u201d purely because of its excellent use of the main theme; a very pensive violin reprises the two-note side of the motif in the first half of the track, before more prominent and rather dramatic electronics then take point in the back half for a very thunderous playthrough of the theme much akin to that of the other Standout Cue\u2019s. Final track \u201cOppenheimer\u201d then ends the score on a (rather typically) downtrodden note, with string and electronic instrumentation coming together for one last and rather ethereal reprisal of the full main theme.\r\nAdvertisements\r\nREPORT THIS AD\r\nOverall, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s score for Oppenheimer is a deeply atmospheric and emotional work, with exciting themes and unique combinations of instruments abound. Central of course to the album is the main theme, which is quite intriguing in both its two and six-note parts; the former is utilised in the louder, more emphatic moments of Oppenheimer\u2019s story where a little drama is called for (see the back half of \u201cDestroyer Of Worlds\u201d for a good example of this), and the latter in the quieter, more thoughtful and reserved moments (such as the first half of \u201cCan You Hear The Music\u201d). The two sides of the theme are used very well in their various appearances across the album, and while I do feel they unfortunately have the now pretty classic G\u00f6ransson soundtrack problem in that they don\u2019t get anywhere near as much album time and lengthy renditions as you would like them to (\u201cCan You Hear The Music\u201d for example I feel could have been at least five minutes long), they are still very enjoyable motifs, and do an excellent job of representing not only the character of Robert J. Oppenheimer but also the solemn task he had in developing the first atomic bomb. The use of the violin as the stylistic centrepiece of the score is also an intriguing choice that fits pretty perfectly with both the themes and the story, and honestly that together with the aforementioned themes makes Oppenheimer\u2018s score well worth checking out.\r\n",

She, with eyes like the dawn, carried the songs of forgotten love in her whispers. He, with a soul painted in melodies, strummed the chords of unsung emotions. In the symphony of their encounters, they found solace within each other's gaze. She spoke in verses, tracing constellations across his heart. He, with tender notes, serenaded her with promises written in the skies. Through moonlit strolls and whispered confessions under a canopy of stars, their love burgeoned like a blossoming melody. Each moment became a verse, etched into the crescendo of their story. From fleeting glances to stolen kisses, their tale was an opus of passion and devotion. But as life's melody often weaves its intricate patterns, distance began to play its somber tune. Their hearts, intertwined in love's rhapsody, now faced the discordance of separation. In the echoes of their memories, he found solace in composing their tale into a song. With each note, he etched their story onto the canvas of music, a ballad of love's enduring essence.

With every chord strummed and every lyric penned, their romance unfolded in the melody, a song of love that soared across the expanse of time.

    "Prompt": "At first glance, simplicity may appear as a mere absence of complexity, a surface-level reduction of elements. However, true simplicity is an art form that involves distilling the essence of an idea, object, or concept to its purest and most fundamental form. This stripping away of unnecessary embellishments reveals a sense of elegance that is deeply appealing and enduring. \r\nIronically, embracing simplicity often requires an appreciation for complexity. The capacity to distinguish the crucial elements amidst a complex array showcases a depth of comprehension that stands as a defining trait of sophistication. Take, for instance, the art of storytelling. A well-crafted narrative weaves together a tapestry of characters, plotlines, and emotions, yet the true mastery lies in conveying this complexity to the audience in a coherent and simple manner. \r\nSimplicity extends beyond aesthetics and intellectual pursuits; it is deeply intertwined with human character and values. In an era where material possessions and societal status often define success, a person who embraces simplicity stands out as a beacon of authenticity and self-awareness. Mahatma Gandhi's minimalist lifestyle, driven by his commitment to truth and non-materialism, exemplifies how simplicity can become a powerful statement of one's principles. It reflects a conscious choice to rise above the superficial and prioritize what truly matters be it personal relationships, ethical values, or the pursuit of knowledge. \r\nIn an age of environmental challenges, simplicity takes on a new dimension as a sustainable way of life. The consumerist culture of excess has led to overconsumption, depletion of resources, and environmental degradation. Embracing simplicity in our consumption patterns, choosing quality over quantity, favoring durable goods over disposables contributes not only to personal well-being but also to the larger goal of preserving the planet for future generations. The concept of minimalism, which encourages mindful consumption and reduction of waste, aligns seamlessly with the principles of sustainability. \r\n\r\nWas reading this article, now if I take the context of art, then what do you think will be the difference between simplicity and complexity?\r\n",

    "Prompt": "\u201c\"A Haunting in Venice\" is the best of Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot movies. It's also one of Branagh's best, period, thanks to the way Branagh and screenwriter Michael Green dismantle and reinvent the source material (Agatha Christie's Hallowe'en Party) to create a relentlessly clever, visually dense \"old\" movie that uses the latest technology. \r\n\r\nSet mainly in a palazzo that seems as immense as Xanadu or Castle Elsinore (it's a blend of actual Venice locations, London soundstages, and visual effects), the movie is threaded with intimations of supernatural activity, most of the action occurs during a tremendous thunderstorm, and the violence pushes the PG-13 rating to its breaking point. It's fun with a dark streak: imagine a ghastly gothic cousin of \"Clue,\" or of something like Branagh's own \"Dead Again,\" which revolved around past lives. At the same time, amid the expected twists and gruesome murders, \"A Haunting in Venice\" is an empathetic portrayal of the death-haunted mentality of people from Branagh's parents' generation who came through World War II with psychic scars, wondering what had been won. \r\n\r\nThe original Christie novel was published in 1969 and set in then-present-day Woodleigh Common, England. The adaptation transplants the story to Venice, sets it over 20 years earlier, gives it an international cast of characters thick with British expats, and retains just a few elements, including the violent death of a young girl in the recent past and the insinuating presence of an Agatha Christie-like crime novelist named Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey), who takes credit for creating Poirot's reputation by making him a character in her writing. Aridane tracks down Poirot in a Venice apartment, where he's retired from detective work and seemingly in existential crisis (though one he'd never discuss without being asked). He seems resolved to a life of aloneness, which is not the same as loneliness. He tells Ariadne he doesn't have friends and doesn't need any. \r\n\r\nAriadne's sales have slumped, so she draws Poirot back into sleuthing by pushing him to attend a Halloween Night seance at the aforementioned home, hoping to produce material that will give her another hit. The medium is a celebrity in her own right: Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh), a character named after the untrustworthy little girl in the original Christie story who claims to have witnessed a murder. Reynolds plans to communicate with a murder victim, Alicia Drake (Rowan Robinson), the teenage daughter of the palazzo's owner, former opera singer Rowena Drake (Kelly Reilly), and hopefully learn who did the deed.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many others gathered in the palazzo. All become suspects in Alicia's murder as well as the subsequent cover-up killings that ensue in these kinds of stories. Poirot locks himself and the rest of the ensemble in the palazzo and announces that no one can leave until he's figured things out. The gallery of possibles includes a wartime surgeon named Leslie Ferrier (Jamie Dornan) who suffers from severe PTSD; Ferrier's precocious son Leopold (Jude Hill, the young lead in Branagh's \"Belfast\"), who is 12 going on 40 and asks unnerving questions; Rowena\u2019s housekeeper Olga Seminoff (Camille Cottin); Maxime Gerard (Kyle Allen), Alicia\u2019s former boyfriend; and Mrs. Reynolds\u2019 assistants Desdemona and Nicholas Holland (Emma Laird and Ali Khan), war refugees who are half-siblings.\r\n\r\nIt would be unsporting to say much about the rest of the plot. Reading the book won't give anything important away because\u2014even more so than in Branagh's previous Poirot films\u2014the kinship between source and adaptation is a bit like the later James Bond films, which might take a title, some character names and locations, and one or two ideas, and invent everything else. Green, who also wrote the recent \"Death on the Nile\" as well as \"Blade Runner 2049\" and much of the series \"American Gods,\" is a reliably excellent screenwriter of fresh stories inspired by canonical material. His work keeps one eye on commerce and the other on art. He regularly reminds nostalgia-motivated viewers in the \"intellectual property\" era of why they like something. At the same time, he introduces provocative new elements and attempts a different tone or focus than audiences probably expected. (The introduction to the movie tie-in paperback of Christie's novel has an introduction by Green that starts with him confessing to a murder of \"the book you are holding.\")\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this Poirot mystery aligns itself with popular culture made in Allied countries after World War II. Classic post-war English-language films like \"The Best Years of Our Lives,\" \"The Third Man,\" \"The Fallen Idol,\" and mid-career Welles films like \"Touch of Evil\" and \"The Trial\" (to name just a few classics that Branagh seems keenly aware of) were not just engrossing, beautifully crafted entertainments, but illustrations of a pervasive collective feeling of moral exhaustion and soiled idealism\u2014the result of living through a six-year period that showcased previously unimaginable horrors, including Stalingrad, Normandy, the mechanized extermination of the Holocaust, and the use of atomic bombs against civilians. And so the embittered Poirot is a seeming atheist who practically sneers at speaking to the dead. Green and Branagh even give him a monologue about his disillusionment that evokes comments made about Christie near the end of her life, and in the novel, about what she perceived as increasingly cruel tendencies in humanity as a whole, reflected in the sorts of crimes that were being committed. \r\n\r\nAside from a few period-specific details and references, the source seems to exist outside of the time in which it was written. Branagh and Green's movie goes in the opposite direction. It's very much of the late 1940s. The children in the film are orphans of war and post-war occupation (soldiers fathered some of them, then went back home without taking responsibility for their actions). There's talk of \"battle fatigue,\" which is what PTSD was called during World War II; in the previous world war, they called it \"shell shock.\" The plot hinges on the economic desperation of native citizens, previously moneyed expatriates who are too emotionally and often financially shattered to recapture the way of life they had before the war, and the mostly Eastern European refugees who didn't have much to start with and do the country's grunt work. The overriding sense is that some of these characters would literally kill to get back to being what they were.\r\n\r\nBranagh was compared to Orson Welles early in his career for obvious reasons. He was a wunderkind talent who became internationally famous in his twenties and often starred in projects he originated and oversaw. He had one foot in theater and the other in film. He loved the classics (Shakespeare especially) and popular film genres (including musicals and horror). He had an impresario's sense of showmanship and the ego to go with it. He's never been more brazenly Wellesian than he is here. This film has a \"big\" feeling, as Welles' films always did, even when they were made for pocket change. But it's not full of itself, wasteful or pokey; like a Welles film, it gets in and out of every scene as fast as possible, and clocks in at 107 minutes, including credits. \r\n\r\nFilm history aficionados may appreciate the many visual acknowledgments of the master's filmography, including ominous views of Venice that reference Welles' \"Othello\" and a screeching cockatoo straight out of \"Citizen Kane.\" At times, it feels as if Branagh conducted a seance and channeled Welles' spirit, as well as that of other directors who worked in a black-and-white, expressionistic, Gothic-flavored, very Wellesian style (including \"The Third Man\" director Carol Reed and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" and \"Seven Days in May\" director John Frankenheimer). Branagh and cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos have also mentioned Richard Brooks's 1967 adaptation of \"In Cold Blood\" and Masaki Kobayashi's \"Kwaidan\" as influences. The movie deploys fish-eye lenses, dutch tilts, hilariously ominous close-ups of significant objects (including a creepy cuckoo clock), extreme low- and high-angles, and deep-focus compositions that arrange the actors from foreground to deep background, with window and door frames, sections of furniture, and sometimes actors' bodies dicing up the shot to create additional frames-within-the-frame. \r\n\r\nLike post-millennial Michael Mann and Steven Soderbergh movies, \"A Haunting in Venice\" was shot digitally (albeit in IMAX resolution) and commits to the idea if letting the medium be what it naturally is, rather than force it to imitate something else. The low-light interior scenes make no attempt to simulate film stock, depriving viewers of that \"comfort food\" feeling that comes from seeing a movie set in the past that uses actual film or tries for a \"film look.\" The result is somewhat unbalancing, in a fascinating way. The images have a mesmerizing hyper-clarity, but also a shimmering, otherworldly aspect, especially in tight close-ups where the actors' eyes seem to have been lit from within. \r\n\r\nBranagh and editor Lucy Donaldson time the cuts so that the more ostentatious images (such as a rat crawling out of a stone gargoyle's mouth, and Poirot and Ariadne seen through the metal screen of a fireplace, flames in the foreground) are on-screen just long enough for the viewer to register what they see, and laugh at how far the movie is willing to go for the effect. Movies are rarely directed in this style anymore, in any format, and it's a shame, because when they are, the too-muchness can be intoxicating.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat is the author's viewpoint of the movie - better, worse or same as the books? How does the author support their stance - give me 5 points. \r\n",

In other words, the main purpose of a business is to make a profit, therefore that should be any company\u2019s most important responsibility and top priority (Desjardins, 2019). With Musk already being the wealthiest person in the world with many thanks to his very successfully run businesses, he made clear early on in the acquisition that he planned on running Twitter under these ideas of individualism. Since he took the company private, wherefrom he operates a number of his other businesses, he no longer has to worry about any interference from a board of directors or shareholders of the company. This freedom allows him to operate under whichever practices he sees fit as long as he remains within the legal confines that all businesses must operate under. The first major action Musk took toward maximizing Twitter\u2019s profits was to lay off a massive amount of full-time employees as reported by Yu on November 5, 2022. Musk claimed that this was an essential step to making Twitter run more efficiently because the company had been losing $4 million at the time of his entry. This is where the ethical problem in this case regarding individualism arose. While Musk did in fact offer 3 months of severance to everyone that received the email that they were being laid off, \u201cwhich is 50% more than legally required\u201d (Musk, @elonmusk, 2022), he did so with only 1 week\u2019s notice causing an uproar among those fired (Yu, 2022). The timeline of the layoffs became the main concern in question in this case. Although his actions were justified ethically by the idea of individualism, seeing as he was acting in the best interest of the company\u2019s profitability, he did so in a manner that violated the legal limits within which he is bound to operate. Musk went about the layoffs in a manner that he thought to be Text Box: Screenshot of Musk\u2019s Tweet in response to criticism surrounding massive layoffs.excusable because he was offering the laid-off employees greater severance packages than what was legally required of him. This is still illegal though, raising the question of how ethical his actions were because mass layoffs on this scale need to be performed with more notice than he provided the employees regardless of how much severance was being offered (Taylor, 2022).\r\nMake this data short without changing its real meaning by giving a short intro then add 6 points for the rest of the content.

    "Prompt": "Striving to be \"better\" acknowledges the fact that there is always room for improvement. The quest to be better is a journey rather than a destination. It is an ongoing process that requires constant self-reflection, growth, and change. The beauty of striving to be better is that there is always something to work on, whether it be a personal or professional aspect of life. By focusing on being better, individuals and companies can adapt to changing circumstances and remain relevant and meaningful in a constantly evolving world.\r\nIn the corporate world, companies that focus on being the best often fall into the trap of complacency. They become so fixated on maintaining their position as the best that they fail to adapt to changing market trends and consumer preferences. In contrast, companies that focus on being better are always looking for ways to improve and innovate. They are willing to take risks and embrace change, which allows them to stay ahead of the curve.\r\nOne example of a company that focuses on being better rather than the best is Amazon. Amazon started as an online bookstore but has since grown into one of the largest retailers in the world. However, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, has always emphasized the importance of being customer-centric and continuously improving the customer experience. This focus on being better has allowed Amazon to stay relevant and meaningful in a constantly changing retail landscape.\r\nAnother example of the importance of being better is in the field of athletics. Athletes who focus solely on being the best often suffer from burnout and injury. In contrast, athletes who focus on being better are more likely to have sustainable success. They understand that there is always room for improvement and that the quest for perfection is a never-ending journey. By focusing on being better, athletes can make incremental improvements that can add up over time.\r\nThe same concept applies to personal growth and development. Individuals who focus on being the best often fall into the trap of comparing themselves to others. They become fixated on external validation and lose sight of their personal goals and values. In contrast, individuals who focus on being better are more likely to have a growth mindset. They understand that failure and setbacks are opportunities for learning and growth. By focusing on being better, individuals can develop the skills and qualities necessary to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.\r\nThe distinction between being the best and being better is not just a matter of semantics. It is a fundamental shift in mindset that can have a significant impact on personal and professional success.\r\n\r\nCan you add a para after the amazon example of Usain Bolt and Neeraj Chopra within the same context.

Also, give me 5 simple and 5 tough revision questions so that I can memorize all the important information for my test- \r\n\r\n\"In 2019, a fashion show was held at the JD Institute of Fashion Technology in Bengaluru. Among the clothes featured in that show were some that used motifs of Pithora, a form of painting practiced by the Rathwa, Bhil, Bhilala, and Nayaka Adivasis of the Chhota Udepur region of Gujarat, among other places. In a statement describing the show on the institute\u2019s website, the student curators claimed that they wanted to \u201cenable the revival of the Pithora art form, to provide recognition and employment opportunities for the tribes\u201d.\r\n\r\nAbout three years later, however, when some members of these communities found photos of the show online, they were deeply distressed by what they felt was the commodification of a sacred and ritualistic form. Members of the Rathwa community hold the view that Pithora is not merely an art, but that its creation is a sacred ritual that commemorates the communities\u2019 ancestors and gods, explained Sejal Rathwa, a journalist and co-ordinator of cultural documentation at the Adivasi Academy, a research and educational institution for Adivasis in Tejgadh, Chhota Udepur.\r\n\r\nIn August 2022, members of the Rathwa community sent an email to JD Institute through the Adivasi Academy. They demanded that the photos of the show be taken down from the institute\u2019s social media pages and website and that the student designers display greater cultural sensitivity about the sacredness of Pithora.\r\n\r\nCommunity members\u2019 repeated efforts to contact professors and students responsible for the event were unsuccessful. Upon calling the institute, Sejal Rathwa was told that the students in question had already graduated by the time the institute received the email and that the institute, thus, had no power to ask them to respond.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople take these photos of Pithora from Google, and unthinkingly use it on clothes and other things,\u201d said Paresh Rathwa, among the best-known lakharas, or practitioners of the form.\r\n\r\nHe added, \u201cThis is their ignorance. If they asked us to teach them Pithora, we would definitely do it. But we would also explain what the form means to us.\u201d After this, he reasoned, people would be less likely to disrespect the form.\r\nThis was not the only controversy centered around Pithora in recent years. In 2022, members of the Rathwa community in Vadodara protested against a Pithora painting made on a wall next to the railway station in the city. \u201cSo many people go in and out of the station every day, it isn\u2019t a place of respect for gods,\u201d said Sejal. Following the protests, the Pithora mural was removed.\r\n\r\nParesh Rathwa himself faced some criticism in September this year after he showcased Pithora at a stall as part of an exhibition that had been set up to promote India\u2019s art and craft heritage on the side-lines of the G20 summit in Delhi. In a social media post, Paresh noted that he had heard some criticism from other members of the Rathwa community that he visited the G20 exhibition to sell Pithora paintings. He clarified in the post that his only aim had been to spread awareness among visitors about the form, and not to sell his work.\r\n\r\nThe subject is a sensitive one. Like Warli, Gond and Saura, Pithora too is a well-known Adivasi form in art circles. In response to government initiatives to promote such forms, and commercialise them to enable artists to earn a living, several traditional artists of the other forms have sold their works. In many instances, work has also been reproduced on clothes, bags and other items that can be sold. This has happened both with and without the community\u2019s consent.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, members of the Rathwa community have remained firm that Pithora should not be commercialised through products. While some artists from the community have painted Pithora on walls and canvases for commercial purposes, they too maintain that Pithora should not be replicated on everyday items.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe sensitivity with which a community member who is an insider, and an outsider look at Pithora is not the same,\u201d said Sejal. \u201cIt is important that the place and values that produce the art are also publicised with it.\u201d\r\n\r\n",

However, not everyone in Crestoria had such dazzling smiles, and so the townsfolk longed for a solution.\r\n\r\nAmidst the medieval market square, a traveling minstrel arrived with tales of a magical elixir known as Colgatium. Legends spoke of its power to banish dragons of bad breath, vanquish armies of plaque, and restore the brilliance of even the dullest teeth. Sir Whitealot, intrigued by the promises of this mystical elixir, embarked on a quest to find Colgatium and share its wonders with the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs Sir Whitealot journeyed through enchanted forests and crossed treacherous dental floss bridges, he encountered mythical creatures plagued by dental dilemmas. With the magical touch of Colgatium, he transformed their dental disasters into beacons of oral brilliance.\r\n\r\nWord of Sir Whitealot's quest spread throughout Crestoria, captivating the hearts and imaginations of the kingdom's inhabitants. The people clamored for Colgatium, yearning to possess the secret elixir that could turn their teeth into pearly wonders.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to Crestoria, Sir Whitealot unveiled the Colgatium elixir, presenting it to the kingdom with great fanfare. The people rejoiced, and soon every household in Crestoria embraced the magical potion that promised radiant smiles and unparalleled dental enchantment.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the legend of Colgatium spread far and wide, becoming a cherished tale told across generations.

Charlotte gazed with the affection of 6597 loving blue-eyed blue bottles. She said, in hushed tones, \"I love you and I want peace.\"\r\nMichelle looked back, even more stressed and still fingering the magic hat. \"Charlotte, let's move in together,\" she replied.\r\nThey looked at each other with healthy feelings, like two miniature, magnificent mice loving at a very peculiar birthday party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two deranged uncles rampaging to the beat.\r\nMichelle regarded Charlotte's wobbly fingers and skinny toes. \"I feel the same way!\" revealed Michelle with a delighted grin.\r\nCharlotte looked jumpy, her emotions blushing like a knowledgeable, kaleidoscopic knife.\r\nThen Charlotte came inside for a nice glass of brandy.\r\n\r\nSuggest me the name for my story with the word \"Relations\" in it.\r\n",

The concept of copula allows to divide the function F into parts, one of which describes the structure of the dependence, and the others only marginal distributions of random variables Xi . \r\nConsider n dimensional random vector X = (X1, . . . , Xn) T with continuous marginal distribution functions F1, . . . , Fn. Applying transformation3 : T : R n \u2192 R n , (x1, . . . , xn) 7\u2192 (F1(x1), . . . , Fn(xn)) element-wise to the components of vector X, we will get that all the marginal distributions of the given vector are uniform on [0, 1] (TXi \u223c U(0, 1)). The joint distribution function C of the vector (F1(x1), . . . , Fn(xn))T is called copula of a random vector X: F(x1, . . . , xn) = P[F1(X1) \u2264 x1, . . . , Fn(Xn) \u2264 xn] = C(F1(x1), . . . , Fn(xn)). Definition. A copula is a distribution function of a random vector in R n with uniform marginal distributions of components on [0, 1]. In other words, a copula is a function C : [0, 1]n \u2192 [0, 1] that has three properties: 1. C(x1, . . . , xn) is strictly increasing in each argument xi ; 2.

(2014) studied the price impact of market order submissions, and limit order submissions and cancellations that contained in the Level 3 order book data, and discussed how these action might affect the limit order book (LOB). This information is adequate for estimating the impact of both current and forthcoming orders on the order book dynamics and, subsequently, price dynamics. We underline significant economic implications for investors leveraging these predictive measures, which display a considerable edge over conventional techniques such as the Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) and the Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) when predicting volatility and expected asset returns. Volatility and return prediction carry tangible economic significance. The principal objective of asset pricing revolves around comprehending the patterns of expected return and its accompanying volatility, as posited by French et al. (1987). Even if expected returns were observed completely, the requirement for theories elucidating their behaviour still persists and the same for the empirical analysis validating them. However, the tasks of measuring volatility and return are well-known intricate: at a lower frequency time scale (like hourly or daily), return variations are primarily influenced by unpredictable news events that impact prices. Upon examination of identical datasets, distinct volatility estimators can manifest disparate characteristics. Notably, according to Cont et al. (2014), these estimators exhibit varied intra-day patterns in different underlying assets. On the other hand, at high-frequency trading scales, they are shadowed by the market microstructure noise generated by market participants, including market makers, informed traders, and noise traders. Cont et al. (2014) proved that the order book depth deeper than best bid and best ask contain information relevant to the price dynamics. Based on this empirical finding, a recent strand of literature attempted machine learning methods to capture the volatility and expected return of assets. Doering et al. (2017) developed convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict price and its volatility. Kercheval and Zhang (2015) employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the order book data. Sirignano (2019) and Sirignano and Cont (2019) developed a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to study the snapshot data of the order book. However, due to the restriction of computing power and model complexity of machine learning models, they are not feasible to study the information in deeper depths of the order book. Our proposed physics-based model defines the concept of Active Depth to distinguish the order book depths relevant with a simplicity in model complexity. The model interpretability is another shortcoming of the machine learning methods labeled as \u2018black boxes\u2019 because of the difficulty to understand the precise reasoning behind them, while the physics-based model provides a straightforward intuition to explain the order book dynamics by modelling it as a physical system. Market microstructure noise is another important topic to consider as it captures various of frictions intrinsic to the trading process. As argued by Ait-Sahalia and Yu (2008), these noises include the bid-ask bounces, discreteness of price fluctuations, differences in trade sizes, the informational content of price changes, strategies of the order flow, and inventory management effects. Eliminating the impact of these noises during investigating the asset price is meaningful for the asset pricing practices, particularly in the high-frequency trading markets. We provide a novel technique to model the order book dynamics that is possible to bypass hence eliminate the impact of both market news and market microstructure noises as they arise from the time series of asset price, volume, bid-ask spread or any other explanatory variables generated by order book dynamics. As a result, our research acts as a foundation upon which future studies can be built, moving the field towards a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that dominate asset pricing and, by extension, the broader financial market dynamics. A physical model on limit order book. Second, we incorporate the empirical asset pricing field with the physical models, which offers a unique perspective on market dynamics. While asset pricing traditionally focuses on determining the intrinsic value of assets, an understanding of the market microstructure \u2013 the system through which the trading of assets takes place \u2013 is crucial to comprehend how the supply and demand for assets are matched and how prices are ultimately discovered. Bouchaud et al. (2002) along with Potters and Bouchaud (2003) elucidated the statistical intricacies inherent to the order book. These empirical investigations served as the foundation of \u2019zero-intelligence\u2019 models. Such models posited that the \u2019stylized facts\u2019 are an emergent outcome of order flow properties and the intrinsic structure of the order book, without the need for the \u2019rationality\u2019 assumptions. In their studies on limit order book, Bouchaud et al. (2002) and Potters and December 5, 2023 DRAFT Bouchaud (2003) offered a systematic exploration of empirical properties, and developed models based on statistical physics that linked the financial markets with physical systems. The increasing interest in applying physical models to finance, both in academia and in the industry, has yielded empirical studies in the field of asset pricing and the field of Econophysics. Bouchaud et al. (2003) examined the complex interplay between order flow and price fluctuations, drawing analogies with the external stimuli in physical systems. Their insights unveiled the market \u2018randomness\u2019. Farmer and Lillo (2004) through rigorous analysis, highlighted a connection between power-law tails in price changes and order flow dynamics, aligning with phenomena observed in physics. Farmer et al. (2006) explored the effects of supply-demand on price movements, contrasting with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Their findings drew parallels with long-range correlations in physical systems. Borland (2012) looked into the statistical pattern during market panics, by harnessing the concept of self-organizing systems from physics. Inspired from these studies in Econophysics, our analysis aim to provide a detailed investigation of the utility of a physical model applied to the challenging problems of modelling the LOB.\r\n\r\nCreate a Trade plan with this, much like a SOP which helps take trades in the market.\r\n",

Then choose one random paragraph and add blanks in it that students need to fill much like in grammar exam.\r\n\r\nDue to its geoclimatic characteristics, India is one of the countries that is most susceptible to natural disasters. Therefore, international cooperation in this field is necessary for the effective management of disasters both within and outside of India's boundaries. At the Glasgow climate summit, the Indian government unveiled the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) program. IRIS uses satellite-based modeling and information systems to help Small Island Developing States to strengthen their technological and institutional capability in order to anticipate, avoid, and reduce the loss and damage brought on by catastrophes. This is a result of the rising understanding that institutional preparedness is essential for successfully managing disasters as a result of prior disaster experiences. Disaster management is increasingly viewed as a process that includes analyzing threats, strengthening community ability, and lowering identified risks through disaster-resistant infrastructure and preparation at all levels.\r\nRemote sensing technology is playing a key role in disaster management. Satellite imaginary imbanded with huge geological, meteorological and climatic and information which is being used in scientific work and other research and developments. ISRO is the organization which took the initiative to launch the satellite to propagate the new dimension for research and development. Satellite imaginary and data are prominently being used by researchers to estimate the change in land use land cover, Loss of biodiversity air pollution, ground water table etc., The Indian space program was started by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. India's first satellite, Aryabhata, was launched on April 19, 1975.\r\nJust three years after India's independence, the Indian Institute of Technology was established in 1950. The effects of globalization are being felt in the Indian society as changes are being accumulated in it. Both the economy as a whole and every sphere of society were affected by globalization. Despite the fact that science has long been a part of a worldwide community, the science and technology (S&T) sector of the twenty-first century is more geographically dispersed, more networked, and more dynamic than ever. In its first five-year plan following independence, India placed a high priority on scientific research. Preeminent scientific institutions like the IITs and IISC were made possible by it. These organizations supported research in India by working with overseas organizations.\r\nSince India's independence, both the installed power generating capacity and the transmission and distribution infrastructure have expanded significantly. The nation's total power-producing capacity has increased, rising from a meagre 1362 MW in 1947 to 448.11 GW by the end of March 2020. Coal based fire plants are the primary source for energy production. Issues with pollution and the disposal of the sizeable amount of ash from coal-based power plants, which form the backbone of India's electricity generation, are being resolved by using strategies to encourage environmentally friendly power development. In order to address concerns with pollution and the disposal of the sizeable amount of ash from coal-based power plants, which are India's main source of energy generation, efforts are being enhanced to encourage environmentally friendly power generation. To lessen the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the NTPC and other Central Power Sector Undertakings are creating a Special Purpose Vehicle.\r\nLong term objectives of India include an overall development of industrial, agricultural and services sectors. Modernization based on rural development, industrial development, Infrastructure, raw material supply etc. will sustain the overall economic development for a long time. Thus, in this way we can say that the government has repaired the roof for the development of the entire economy. It will be helpful in resolving all types of existential financial concerns. \r\n",

    "Prompt": "On 13 September 1944, Noor Inayat Khan, the first female wireless operator to be flown into occupied France, was shot at Dachau. The descendant of Tipu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore, Noor was born in Moscow and raised in the Sufi style of Islam. From this unlikely background she became the only Asian secret agent in Europe in World War II, was one of three women in the SOE to be awarded the George Cross and the Croix de Guerre. Shrabani Basu's new book tells the full story of this extraordinarily heroic woman. Noor was brought up in France and Britain and joined the Red Cross when world War II broke out. In Britain, Noor trained as a wireless operator before being recruited by the SOE. Such was the urgent demand for radio operators that she was sent to France before her training was completed. Working under the code name of Madeleine, she joined a group that sabotaged communication lines. But disaster struck quickly and within days, her circuit collapsed and her colleagues were arrested. Though instructed by her controller, the famous Maurice Buckmaster, to return home, she refused to abandon her post as she was the last radio operator left in Paris. For a time she successfully dodged the Gestapo, but by late 1943 her luck had run out. She was betrayed, arrested and imprisoned at Avenue Foch. Undaunted, she made two dramatic escape attempts, but was recaptured and sent to Germany. Here she was interrogated and tortured and finally sent to Dachau, where she was shot. The Germans had learned nothing from her - not even her real name.\r\n\r\nSummarize the text above to be a book description to be printed on the back cover of the action packed memoir of Noor Inayat Khan.

    "Prompt": "Professor Paul Freedman: We\u2019re going to talk about monasticism today. And monasticism in the popular imagination, and accurately, is linked to learning. We all have this image of monks quietly copying manuscripts, and those manuscripts being how the learning of the ancient world was transmitted. We\u2019re going to talk a little more about that when we come to near the end of the course on intellectuals in the court of Charlemagne. But monasticism and learning are linked in our mind, but they are not intrinsically linked. There is no logical reason why monks should copy manuscripts. They should pray. They should live in some kind of renunciation of the world. Generally speaking in the medieval West, they live in communities. Generally speaking, they are engaged in a kind of corporate rather than individual prayer. All of these things follow from the way monasticism was conceived. And the major text, though not the only one, but the most influential text about how monasticism was conceived, is the sixth century Rule of Saint Benedict. The Rule of Saint Benedict has some possible references to sacred reading, as it calls it, or to some kind of program of knowledge. It assumes that the monks are literate, for example, a lot to assume at that time. But nowhere does Benedict say, \u201cPlease preserve the classical tradition by being scribes and writing and the Scriptorium.\u201d So how does this come about, is one of the problems that we will deal with. But what we\u2019re really interested [in] is monasticism without the learning. And the reason we\u2019re interested in that is not only is this the prevailing spiritual movement of the early Middle Ages, but it has a tremendous influence on society outside the monastic walls. Because central to our discussion is a paradox. The paradox is that while the monks are trying to escape the world, the world is following them. The world is very interested in their prayers, because their prayers are thought to have a powerful real -world, this- world, effect. So as the monks become more distant from society, God hears their prayers with more and more sympathy. Therefore their prayers have a kind of power, a power to benefit others. This notion of power is like some kind of almost electrical utility. They\u2019re building up an incredible amount of electricity, if you want to call it that, or let\u2019s say spiritual energy to be more accurate. Way more than they need; way more than they can consume. They\u2019re like some little Persian Gulf state that is producing ten percent of the world\u2019s oil. There\u2019s no way they can use all of that. In this case then, how does the surplus get distributed? It gets distributed through the generosity of people outside the [correction: monastic] world worried about the condition of their souls. The notion that I, possessor of spiritual reserves and spiritual power, can pray for you, sinful knight, sinful king, sinful merchant, is called intercession. The notion that I can intercede for you\u2013 and we\u2019ve already seen this, haven\u2019t we? We\u2019ve seen this with the saints in Gregory of Tours and in other texts. We\u2019ve tried to emphasize how important the saints are, not just for our understanding of medieval religion, but for our understanding of medieval society. Remember that I tried to emphasize that one of the problems, once you\u2019re done with the Roman Empire, is how society is held together. In the Roman Empire, it\u2019s pretty clear. It\u2019s held together by institutions that, although not the same as our own, are translatable to our own: law, administrative structure, landholding, the whole panoply of what passes for civilized life. But in the early Middle Ages, after the collapse of the Roman Empire, we\u2019ve seen the society does not have as much literacy, does not have very good records. The kings are thugs. The political order is very unstable. There\u2019s an awful lot of warfare. There\u2019s a lot of disorder. You can\u2019t just dial 9-1-1 and expect a response. So the question then becomes what holds that society together? And we mentioned some things, including the Church. And here we\u2019re looking at a particular instance of how that works. Because the monks, far from being kind of out there in the forest or desert or some remote region, or even if they are in the forest or desert and some remote region, are extremely important to how society functions. Because this is a society in which the spiritual, the military, the political, the economic, are not easily conceptually separated. This is the Middle Ages, OK? You love the Middle Ages, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be here together. But this is the part of the Middle Ages that is perhaps most medieval. What could be more medieval than monasticism? When I started teaching, which wasn\u2019t that long after the Middle Ages, but when I started teaching, monasticism was a real problem, because it was so alien. What are these people doing? In a way the situation is better, because monasticism is sort of chic, at least temporary weekend monasticism. People think of monasteries sort of like spas. You go there to get cleansed. In fact a lot of monasteries have taken on a lot of new business with retreats, and detoxification, and pilgrimage, and these kinds of concepts. But at the same time, while I think we understand the desire to renounce the world or to take time off from the world or to leave the personal digital devices at home and think about something for more than three seconds at a time, all of this is temporary. The whole point of detoxification is that you then go and re-toxify yourself or go back to normal life. What we have to understand here are people who have decided to embrace a world-renouncing way of life for good. Now monks, therefore, are clergy. They are professional members of the Church. But they\u2019re not priests. It\u2019s key that you understand the difference. Priests interact with the laity. Layman, laity, are people who are ordinary people, believers but not clergy. The priests interact with the laity through mass, the performance of the sacraments, things like baptism, a little bit later than this period, confession, anointment of the sick. These are things in which the sacred is conveyed from the spiritual world to laypeople via priests. Priests are in that sense the intermediaries between the divine and the material. But because priests are involved in the world, there are certain aspects of their differentiation from the world, and there\u2019s a lot of debate in the Church at various times over whether that includes celibacy, not getting married. In the era that we\u2019re dealing with, there are married priests, or there are priests who are more or less married. And then there are priests who are celibate. But monks are not supposed to interact with the world. They are leading a life of contemplation and self-denial. True, they cannot focus only on their own salvation. Because that would mean ignoring the Christian\u2019s duty to others. One of the problems about being a contemplative in the Christian tradition is as soon as you say something like, \u201cBoy, I am really contemplating great today.\u201d Or, \u201cWow, I am really seeing the mysteries of the universe.\u201d Or, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t had anything to eat or drink for three days and am feeling great.\u201d You are falling off. You\u2019re falling away. You\u2019re selfish. You\u2019re taking pride in your own accomplishments. So from the beginning is the notion that the monks have to abandon everything, including self-satisfaction. In fact even most importantly self-satisfaction. And this is where Benedict\u2019s notion of humility comes from, which is very strong in The Rule of Saint Benedict. \r\n\r\nHow does the concept of monasticism differ for male and female practitioners in various religious traditions in the given context?",

    "Prompt": "Examples of mean-reverting spreads are well-documented in a variety of empirical studies spanning diverse asset classes. They have been observed in pairs of stocks and ETFs (Gatev et al. (2006), Avellaneda and Lee (2010), Montana and Triantafyllopoulos (2011), Leung and Li (2016)), futures contracts (Brennan and Schwartz (1990), Dai et al. (2011)), physical commodity and commodity stocks/ETFs (Kanamura et al. (2010)), as well as cryptocurrencies (Leung and Nguyen (2019)). The work of Gatev et al. (2006) stands as one of the pioneering studies in the realm of mean reversion trading, often referred to as pairs trading due to their method\u2019s reliance on pairs to construct a meanreverting process. They introduce the widely adopted Distance Method (DM) and conduct empirical testing using CRSP stocks spanning from 1962 to 2002. The DM method initiates a trading position for a pair of assets when their prices deviate from each other by more than two historical standard deviations, subsequently closing the position when the prices converge again. Their findings reveal an excess return of 1.3 % for the top 5 pairs identified by the DM method and 1.4% for the top 20 pairs. Furthermore, Do and Faff (2012) delve into the profitability of pairs trading while accounting for transaction costs. Their research extends the understanding of the practicality of pairs trading by incorporating the impact of transaction expenses, offering valuable insights into the real-world feasibility of this trading strategy. In addition to the Distance Method (DM), cointegration tests are commonly employed in various alternative methods for mean reversion trading. Vidyamurthy (2004) elucidate a cointegration framework for mean reversion trading, drawing inspiration from Engle and Granger\u2019s error correction model representation of cointegrated series as presented in the seminal work of Engle and Granger (1987). Galenko et al. (2012) explore an active ETF trading strategy built upon cointegrated time series. Their research leverages the concept of cointegration to develop trading strategies within the context of exchange-traded funds. Leung and Nguyen (2019) construct cointegrated portfolios of cryptocurrencies using the Engle-Granger two-step approach and the Johansen cointegration test, exemplifying the versatility of cointegration in portfolio construction across diverse asset classes. Huck and Afawubo (2015) undertake a comparative analysis of the performance of the DM method and cointegrationbased approaches using the components of the S&P 500 index. This study sheds light on the relative merits of these two methodologies in the context of mean reversion trading. Another popular approach in mean reversion trading is the stochastic spread method, which characterizes the path behavior of the spread using a stochastic process exhibiting mean-reverting properties. In this methodology, the construction of spreads and the extraction of trading signals typically rely on the analysis of parameters within the underlying stochastic model. For instance, Elliott et al. (2005) introduce a mean-reverting Gaussian Markov chain model to describe the dynamics of spreads. They utilize this model\u2019s estimates in comparison with observed spread data to make informed trading decisions. Expanding on this framework, Do et al. (2006) delve deeper into the methodology proposed by Elliott et al. and present a generalized stochastic residual spread method. This method is designed to model relative mispricing, offering a broader perspective on the stochastic spread approach in mean reversion trading. In their comprehensive work, Leung and Li (2016) provide insights into optimal mean reversion trading strategies founded on various stochastic modeling approaches. Their research encompasses a range of models, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model, Exponential OU Model, and CIR Model, elucidating how these different models can be leveraged to optimize mean reversion trading strategies. This work contributes to the broader understanding of mean reversion trading by exploring the effectiveness of diverse stochastic frameworks. Furthermore, various alternative methods for mean reversion trading have emerged in recent years. Some of these methods leverage copulas (Liew and Wu (2013), Xie et al. (2016)), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Avellaneda and Lee (2010), and machine learning techniques (Guijarro-Ordonez et al. (2021)) to identify trading opportunities based on statistical patterns and relationships among assets. In addition to these methodologies, new optimization algorithms have been proposed to construct spreads with maximum in-sample mean reversion. Notably, some of these algorithms are designed for automation, enabling the simultaneous analysis of a large number of stocks (d\u2019Aspremont (2011), Leung et al. (2020)). These advancements reflect the ongoing innovation in the field of mean reversion trading, offering traders and researchers a diverse set of tools and techniques to explore. In the domain of optimal timing strategies for trading mean-reverting spreads, several notable studies have contributed to the understanding of this field. Ekstr\u00a8om et al. (2011) investigate the optimal single liquidation timing in the context of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model with zero longrun mean and no transaction costs. Song et al. (2009) introduce a numerical stochastic approximation scheme to solve for optimal buy-low-sell-high strategies over a finite time horizon. Leung and Li (2015) address an optimal double stopping problem, providing optimal entry and exit decision rules. They derive analytical solutions for both the entry and exit problems under the assumption of an OU process. These studies collectively contribute to the advancement of optimal timing strategies for trading meanreverting spreads, offering various perspectives and methodologies for tackling this challenging problem. The current paper is motivated by the model introduced by these prior researchers, proposing a sequential optimal stopping problem to determine optimal trading times without assuming specific dynamics for the spread. The utilization of the signature method in the paper to address the optimal stopping problem aligns with recent developments in mathematical finance. Bayer et al. (2021) have introduced a novel approach to solving optimal stopping problems based on signature theory. Importantly, this method does not require specific assumptions about the underlying stochastic process other than it being a continuous (geometric) random rough path. The core concept revolves around considering classic stopping times approximated as signature optimal stopping times, which can be decided through a functional of the signature associated with the stochastic process. Bayer et al. demonstrate that optimizing over these classes of signature stopping times effectively solves the original optimal stopping problem. This transformation allows for the problem to be reformulated as an optimization task dependent solely on the truncated signature. Furthermore, Bayer et al. introduce a numerical solution to the signature optimal stopping problem by formulating the problem as an optimization task involving the minimization of a loss function associated with the truncated signature. This numerical approach provides a practical tool to implement the signature-based framework for solving optimal stopping problems, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios. They illustrate the practicality of this method in the context of optimal stopping for fractional Brownian motions. Indeed, motivated by the innovative methodology introduced by Bayer et al. (2021), our paper embarks on an exploration of the potential application of the signature framework to tackle the optimal entry and exit problem in mean reversion trading. This extension highlights the remarkable versatility and promising capabilities of signature-based methods in effectively addressing a wide spectrum of challenges within financial contexts.\r\n\r\nIn a list write name of all the research papers shown here and a way I can find them(URL, archive, website)\r\n",

Whiskers was known for his adventurous spirit and had a favorite spot near the old oak tree where he loved to nap in the warm sunlight. One day, while Whiskers was taking a nap, he had a vivid dream about a mysterious treasure hidden deep within the enchanted forest.\r\nIn the dream, Whiskers saw a shimmering map that led to the treasure, and he couldn't resist the urge to embark on a grand adventure. As he woke up, Whiskers decided to follow the dream's clues and set off into the dense woods, his small paws leaving tiny prints in the soft soil.\r\nAs Whiskers delved deeper into the forest, he encountered a wise old owl perched on a branch. The owl, sensing Whiskers' determination, offered some advice. \"To find the treasure, you must trust your instincts,\" hooted the owl, its eyes gleaming in the moonlight. Whiskers nodded, grateful for the guidance.\r\nWith newfound confidence, Whiskers continued his journey, encountering various challenges along the way. He faced rushing streams, towering trees, and slippery moss-covered rocks. Each obstacle tested Whiskers' resilience, but he pressed on, remembering the owl's words.\r\nFinally, after much perseverance, Whiskers stumbled upon a hidden glade bathed in a soft, golden glow. In the center of the glade lay the treasure chest, adorned with intricate carvings. Whiskers couldn't believe his luck and felt a surge of joy. He had discovered the treasure that had been the subject of his dream.\r\nAs Whiskers opened the chest, he found a collection of sparkling gems and a note that read, \"The real treasure is the journey itself.\" The wise words resonated with Whiskers, and he realized that the core of his adventure was not just the physical treasure but the experiences, challenges, and friends he had encountered along the way.\r\nWith the treasure in tow, Whiskers returned to Everwood, where he became a local legend. The townsfolk marveled at his bravery and the magical tale of the cat who followed his dreams, guided by the wise owl's counsel. And so, Whiskers continued to bask in the warm sunlight near the old oak tree, knowing that the true treasures were the memories of his grand adventure in the enchanted forest.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Accurate valuation of post-revenue drug assets plays an instrumental role in a broad range of operations and decisions in the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors. Investment decisions heavily depend on accurate valuations. They inform decisions made not only by pharmaceutical companies but also by a range of stakeholders including venture capitalists, private equity firms, and others. An accurate valuation provides a reliable forecast of the potential return on investment, which directly influences where and how capital is allocated within the industry. It forms the basis of strategic investment decisions, making it possible to identify the most promising opportunities and understand which investments are more likely to yield a satisfactory return. Valuation plays a key role in the due diligence process of Mergers and Acquisitions. During this phase, buyers conduct a comprehensive analysis of both the financial and operational aspects of the target company. The valuation serves as a crucial reference point against which the findings of the due diligence are evaluated. Any significant disparities identified may trigger further investigation or necessitate adjustments to the deal terms. Overestimating or underestimating the value of a pharmaceutical asset will result in the buyer paying more than necessary or the seller receiving less than their potential earnings. Therefore, an accurate valuation is imperative to ensure fairness and equity in transactions for all parties involved. In addition, given the inherent uncertainties in drug development and approval processes in risk management, a proper valuation provides a realistic appraisal of potential risks and rewards, aiding in strategic planning and contingency creation. Moreover, it facilitates effective prioritization within a company\u2019s drug portfolio, empowering firms to make informed decisions about resource allocation based on the projected value of individual assets. Accurate valuation also becomes paramount in regulatory and legal scenarios involving patent disputes, litigation, or other regulatory matters, where a drug asset\u2019s value might be a critical piece of evidence. Lastly, precise valuation reinforces market confidence and upholds the credibility and integrity of the biopharma sector. It serves as a bulwark against asset price inflation, safeguarding financial stability in the market by ensuring that the disclosed value aligns with the real worth of the asset. After a drug has gained regulatory approval and becomes a monetizable asset, there are clinical risks that could influence its valuation. Post-market safety issues may emerge that lead to product recalls or the imposition of black-box warnings. Securing reimbursement from insurers or government healthcare programs can present challenges, even for an approved drug. The level of reimbursement can greatly influence the uptake of the drug and hence its revenue generation. Rapid advancements in technology and changes in medical practice can impact the relevance and efficacy of a drug, which can dramatically affect its valuation. A drug that was once deemed revolutionary can quickly become obsolete due to the advent of a new technologies or shifts in medical practice. Finally, when a patent expires, it can lead to the introduction of generic competition, which in turn can lead to a significant reduction in revenues of the branded drug. While the timing of patent expiration is generally known, predicting the impact of generic competition on sales is itself a complex task and can be dependent on factors including the complexity of the manufacturing process, the competitive landscape of the generic market, market exclusivity periods, potential pricing strategies by generic competitors, the breadth and loyalty of the customer base for the branded drug, the marketing and distribution capabilities of the generic drug manufacturers, and potential regulatory changes. Understanding these dynamics requires deep industry knowledge and careful analysis of market trends, making it a challenging aspect of post-revenue drug asset valuation. Valuing post-revenue drug assets is a complex undertaking due to several interrelated factors. The pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors are characterized by a high degree of volatility. Decisions at the political level, economic cycles, technological breakthroughs, and public health crises can all trigger significant fluctuations in the market. Such unpredictability further complicates the task of accurately forecasting the performance of a drug. An accurate valuation requires a clear understanding of the market size, penetration rates, competition, pricing, and adoption rates by doctors and patients. Adding to the complexity is the dynamic nature of the regulatory environment. Changes in regulations around pricing, alterations in patent laws, or shifts in approval processes can all unexpectedly impact a drug\u2019s future revenue. Valuing pharmaceutical assets and the portfolios they comprise has seen some modest recent activity. Kellogg et al, [4] proposed a real-options approach to valuing Small Life Sciences Companies (SLSC) which Kane et al.[3] distinguished from Biotechnology companies with the latter tending to hold both pre- and postrevenue assets and the former holding pre-revenue assets almost exclusively. Stasior [12] recently propose a risk-adjusted, net present value (rNPV) model for individual assets that incorporates the unique risks and rewards associated with post-revenue pharmaceutical assets. Michaeli et al. [8] evaluated the association of Biopharma company valuation with the lead drug\u2019s development stage, orphan status, number of indications, and disease area and estimate annual returns entrepreneurs and investors can expect from founding and investing in drug development ventures. For post-revenue valuations specifically, Ledley et al. [7] provide a comparison of pharmaceutical companies with other types of companies, finding that they are more profitable than other companies. The literature becomes sparse beyond this point, with almost no studies examining either the valuation of individual drug assets and uncertainty in those estimates or the valuation of portfolios as it relates to the market price of Biotech or Pharmaceutical companies. This paper fills in this gap by proposing and validating a model for future revenue for individual assets based on publicly available sales taking into account the process of market penetration, the inevitable incidents like loss of intellectual property rights, and competition for an indication, with the assumption that the incidents will cause the symmetrical decrease of the sales. An Epidemiology Sales Prediction Model also aims to predict the sales of health-related products by integrating epidemiological data such as incidence and prevalence rates of certain diseases, demographic data, healthcare policies, and other relevant factors that might impact the sales of these products[11]. One drawback of these models is their heavy dependency on accurate epidemiological data[2]; however, obtaining high-quality data can sometimes be a challenge. Another drawback is the inherent complexity of the model, which can make it difficult to understand and use, especially for individuals not familiar with epidemiological principles. This complexity also may compromise the robustness of the model. The general and straightforward prior assumption in our model can substitute for the complex scenarios in epidemiology well. This paper presents a model designed to estimate future sales of post-revenue assets using their historical sales data. This data, known for its high quality, is readily accessible in the company\u2019s financial records. The model generates distributional estimates of each asset\u2019s cumulative sales, aiding in the calculation of the asset\u2019s Net Present Value (NPV). Applied to Pfizer\u2019s portfolio of post-revenue assets, this model accurately projects the company\u2019s market capitalization\u2014defined as the product of its share price and the number of outstanding shares\u2014to within a 10% margin. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 3 describes the sales curve in the classic Product Life-cycle [10] as it applies to the pharmaceutical industry. From this description, a model is proposed in Section 4 taking into account the market demand for a therapy, limits on intellectual property rights, and competition. The model is validated using Pfizer\u2019s current drug assets sales in Section 5. Section 6 provides to post-hoc analyses of the model with first indicating that the model accuracy is not enhanced by auxiliary information related to the therapy or indication space and the second identifying differences in uptake of therapies by their indication class. Section 7 aggregates the individual asset valuations and their uncertainties to provide an estimate of Pfizer\u2019s current post-revenue portfolio value and compares that estimate with Pfizer\u2019s current market capitalization. The paper concludes with a discussion in Section 8 which proposes extensions to revenue planning and to pre-revenue valuation.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a research on Pfizer stocks and their share price movement. Tell me if you can find something useful, like trade scenarios which can make me money.",

There were four to a room, and whenRoberta and me came, there was a shortage of state kids, so we were theonly ones assigned to 406 and could go from bed to bed if we wanted to.And we wanted to, too. We changed beds every night and for the wholefour months we were there we never picked one out as our own permanentbed. It didn't start out that way. The minute I walked in and the Big Bozointroduced us, I got sick to my stomach. It was one thing to be taken out ofyour own bed early in the morning-it was something else to be stuck in astrange place with a girl from a whole other race. And Mary, that's mymother, she was right. Every now and then she would stop dancing longenough to tell me something important and one of the things she said wasthat they never washed their hair and they smelled funny. Roberta sure did.Smell funny, I mean. So when the Big Bozo (nobody ever called her Mrs.Itkin, just like nobody every said St. Bonaventure)-when she said, \\\"Twyla,this is Roberta. Roberta, this is Twyla.

    "Prompt": "So what is the importance of mining activity for India? A country like India, which is still plagued by dwindling economic indicators like non-reliable service driven growth and more than 1/5th of population facing extreme poverty (according to World Bank\u2019s estimates), requires certain economic boosts to bring it onto a more stable path of development. One of such boosts is building a strong manufacturing industrial sector, which would induce more employment opportunities, boost trade and eventually improve our Human Development Indicators.\r\nIt requires substantial increase in availability of minerals like iron ore and bauxite. The non-renewable source dependent energy generation capability of India makes mining of coal and other hydrocarbons, a backbone of manufacturing growth for India. This is appended by the exponentially growing demand of people for goods like automobiles and services like electricity, which in many cases leads to increase in import of their raw materials due to inadequate domestic mining.\r\nThis shows that mining as an economic activity is an important bottleneck for envisaging India\u2019s economic growth indicators reaching to a more stable and dependable figure.\r\nNow where do the tribes come in the picture? According to the estimates, about 80% of India\u2019s proven coal reserves lie in forested areas, chiefly inhabited by tribes. This is also true with the distribution of other minerals in the country. Thus, when the country decides to expand its mineral exploration and mining, it eventually leads to massive deforestation and displacement of tribes.\r\nAlong with this, mining also leaves behind it a massive trail of chaos. The land relief is completely altered, land becomes barren in many cases, ground water resources and other fresh water resources become polluted with poisonous metals like arsenic, mercury and sulphuric acid. The rehabilitation of displaced tribes leads to a drastic change in their social ecology. In other words, their normal way of life is disrupted, their source of living and food, which are mainly derived from forests, are severely modified.\r\nOn one hand, rehabilitation takes a lot of time to complete, making tribal people temporarily homeless, on the other, many tribal people aren\u2019t covered under rehabilitation policy for trivial reasons like lack of proper documents or mismatch of spellings of name and address in official documents, to name a few. But even after being eligible for rehabilitation, there is no place like home for any human being, especially for tribal people.\r\nHow come home of tribal homes are seen in same light as homes in cities? I mean tribal homes can be relocated in a day\u2019s notice and there\u2019s vast forests which all are alike and have no discernable difference.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Starting after the 1974 test, rates of cancer and genetic abnormalities, birth defects or developmental delays, began to climb. In this region of Pokhran, it seems that nearly every family has a story of a loved one suddenly lost to cancer. Following \u2018Smiling Buddha\u2019, land and homes were destroyed, crops turned white, skin and eye irritation began, and soon diseases struck. The same occurred, but on a larger scale in 1998. The effects of radiation have compounded over decades in the villages because groundwater was contaminated. Residents ingest radiation from both the 1974 and 1998 tests and genetic mutations are passed through generations. A village leader in Khetolei estimated that 56 people had died of cancer every year since 1998. The population is only about 3,000 people. The cancer mortality rate seems to be four times the national average. Children seem to be particularly at risk. Rates of childhood cancer and mortality seem to be increasing. Birth defects and genetic abnormalities, even in children born years after the tests, are common. There are many children who have never learned to walk or speak. High rates of breast cancer have also been reported. Unfortunately, this is to be expected: ionizing radiation, which is released in a nuclear explosion, disproportionately affects rapidly growing and dividing cells, which are generally found in women and children. Despite nuclear weapons testing\u2019s obvious health effects, the Indian government only provided compensation for land damaged immediately after the test. Multiple small-scale studies have confirmed that there is a dangerous health phenomenon near Pokhran. But there has been no government-accepted investigation and the villages must rely on their own estimates of cancer deaths and other illnesses. With no formal study, it is hard for residents to demand assistance because they cannot explicitly point to the nuclear weapons tests as the cause. \r\n\r\nPokhran Residents by Neha Dixit\r\n\r\nThe global consequences of \u201climited and regional\u201d problems\r\nUnderground nuclear tests, like India\u2019s, were argued to be a safer alternative than atmospheric or underwater tests. That\u2019s why the Partial Test Ban Treaty, adopted in 1963 by the US and the Soviet Union, banned all nuclear tests, except for those performed underground. One look at Pokhran and it\u2019s obvious this is wrong. Even if no one sees the mushroom clouds, underground tests can still have the same devastating health effects as atmospheric tests. The ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan is often perceived to be a \u2018regional threat\u2019. But a so-called \u201climited\u201d nuclear war still has catastrophic effects -- and those are rarely recognized when political action is taken in Kashmir and nuclear war is threatened. A limited war still destroys cities, kills thousands, and injures hundreds of thousands more. Furthermore, it would have environmental effects that would harm global agriculture, trigger famine, and place close to two billion people worldwide at the brink of starvation. The environment and communities near Pokhran have suffered without recognition or care. And the current political environment places them at risk again. The 1998 tests were ordered when the current political party was last in power. The recent changed political status of Kashmir has dramatically increased tensions with Pakistan and in Kashmir. India and Pakistan have gone to war three times before and it is civilians and Kashmiris who suffer the most. Now there is talk of war again, this time with mentions of nuclear weapons. This creates a scenario where the legacy of India\u2019s nuclear tests reaches far beyond Pokhran and creates a global humanitarian catastrophe. Check this out for photos of Pokhran residents, that speak a thousand words about the impact of nuclear testing.\r\nWhy is India's first nuclear weapons test called Operation Smiling Buddha and does naming it have any cultural meaning as per the context, and can you give a literature perspective over this name from the context?\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Find what changed in financial stats from this text. Show in bullet points.\r\nFollowing independence, India's economy remained mostly agrarian for a long time. Any robust economy is built on its foundation of the industrial sector. The productivity and production were incredibly poor. Technology was not advanced and lagged behind. Only the cotton and jute industries were well-established at that point of time. The country's infrastructure has to be improved as one of the first conditions for economic growth. Today, it is close to Rs 150 lakh crore. India, formerly referred to as a \"third world country,\" today ranks among the world's largest economies. This journey of India from Rs 2.7 lakh crore to 150 lakh crore GDP reflects that India has tried a lot to repair its roof when the sun is shining by utilizing appropriate opportunity at right and right time.\r\nWhen India became independent in 1947, the colonial military of British India became the armed forces of independent India. The Indian Military was split equally between India and Pakistan as a result of the division of India. After World War II, a substantial demobilization campaign resulted in the discharge of the vast majority of the 1.25 million wartime troops and the dissolution of their regiments. Three wars between India and Pakistan 1947\u20131948, 1965, and 1971 were huge setbacks for India's security. During these set back India fought very precisely and when the war was over the introspection revealed that the army should be modernized and enlarged. India appears to be modernizing its nuclear and military capabilities. Nuclear deterrence and no first attack are India's publicly stated policies. However, as seen by its modernization efforts, particularly its ballistic missile program, India is eager to bring all of China within striking range. India's nuclear arsenal is the seventh largest in the world. These are the few steps India is doing to fix its roof so it can protect itself from any external aggression or war.\r\nThe share of agriculture in employment declined from about 82% in 1950/51 to about 72 percent by 2001. During the same duration, the share of agriculture in total GDP also declined from approximately 54% in 1950/51 to 24% by 2001. This shift is basically indicating that dependability on agriculture for employment is reducing because the industrial sector is providing employment to the agricultural laborer as an industrial worker. India transformed from a country with a food scarcity to one of the top agricultural producers in the world. This was made possible by the Green Revolution. The green revolution was launched during the second Five Year Plan to address India's food deficit problem.\r\nDue to its geoclimatic characteristics, India is one of the countries that is most susceptible to natural disasters. Therefore, international cooperation in this field is necessary for the effective management of disasters both within and outside of India's boundaries. At the Glasgow climate summit, the Indian government unveiled the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) program. IRIS uses satellite-based modeling and information systems to help Small Island Developing States to strengthen their technological and institutional capability in order to anticipate, avoid, and reduce the loss and damage brought on by catastrophes. This is a result of the rising understanding that institutional preparedness is essential for successfully managing disasters as a result of prior disaster experiences. Disaster management is increasingly viewed as a process that includes analyzing threats, strengthening community ability, and lowering identified risks through disaster-resistant infrastructure and preparation at all levels.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "For interpolation, we propose to linearly superimpose the ARIR triplet around the listening position with weights depending on the variable position. As shown in [11, 35], a purely distance-weighted linear interpolation yields a fair directional reproduction of a recorded sound field. Therefore, we initially introduce distance weights gi(xd) that specify the contribution of each ARIR of the triplet hi(t), i 2 {1, 2, 3} to the interpolated result by emphasizing close ARIRs and attenuating distant ones. For a horizontal, equidistant square ARIR grid with zi = 0, it can be defined by, gi\u00f0xd\u00de \u00bc G cos2 p 2r \u00f0xd xi\u00de cos2 p 2r \u00f0yd yi \u00de ; \u00f01\u00de with the grid positions xi = [xi, yi, zi] T and listener perspective xd = [xd, yd, zd] T. r is the grid spacing of neighboring ARIRs and G is chosen so that P3 i\u00bc1gi(xd) = 1. The according interpolation of ARIR triplets would yield, d\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc X3 i\u00bc1 gi\u00f0xd\u00de hi\u00f0t\u00de; \u00f02\u00de where d(t) denotes the interpolated ARIR at the desired listener perspective xd. However, the purely distance-weighted, linear interpolation alone can cause problems such as strong comb filtering artifacts due to the temporally and directionally misaligned superposition of the direct sound peaks or prominent early reflection peaks. Hereby, linear interpolation can smear such peaks either temporally or directionally, causing either an increased number of apparent peaks that are too low in amplitude or which may lack energy in the higher-order channels. Most often, this causes perceivable fluctuations of sound coloration or room impressions (distance, width) when moving through the virtual room, which is also reflected in the evaluation (cf. Sect. 6). Superior performance is expected when interpolation is preceded with perspective extrapolation, i.e. a prior parametric translation of the measured ARIR perspectives to the desired listener perspective. ARIR extrapolation The proposed perspective extrapolation decomposes an ARIR into short time segments, of which each one is interpreted as an instantaneous sound event, corresponding to an acoustic propagation path, e.g. a discrete reflection, in the room. Extrapolation ensures that sound events, such as peaks in the ARIRs, get time-aligned, level-aligned, and direction-aligned consistent with what should be received at the variable listening perspective. And yet, extrapolation should be as content-preserving as possible, and therefore its alignments in time, level, and direction within the ARIRs need to be done carefully. For instance, alignment needs not be processed individually for every sample of the ARIR if the temporal context can be preserved with a constant time shift of finite time segments. Directional alignment needs not destroy directional context if it can be done by rotation. The perspective extrapolation of a single ARIR time instant or segment hi(t) from the ARIR perspective xi to the desired listener perspective xd is done assuming a known instantaneous sound-event position x^t locating the ARIR time instant or segment in space (cf. Fig. 2). 2.2.1 Rotation As a first step, extrapolation applies a rotation to the sound-event direction of arrival (DOA) hd(x^t) that is consistent with what a listener should receive at the translated position. The rotation is accomplished by multiplying the ARIR time instant or segment with an Nth-order spherical harmonics rotation matrix R\u00f0N\u00de sp \u00f0x^t\u00de (6) that is determined by a Cartesian 3 3 rotation matrix Rxyz(x^t). The rotation aligns the observed DOA in form of the Cartesian unit vector hi(x^t) with the DOA hd(x^t) at the target perspective, i.e. hd(x^t) = Rxyz(x^t)hi(x^t), in azimuth and zenith, Rxyz\u00f0 \u00de\u00bc x^t Rz ud \u00f0 \u00deRy \u00f0 \u00de #d #i Rz ui \u00f0 \u00de; \u00f03\u00de with Rz\u00f0 \u00dea \u00bc cos\u00f0\u00de a sin \u00f0 \u00dea 0 sin \u00f0 \u00dea cos\u00f0 \u00dea 0 0 01 2 6 4 3 7 5; Ry \u00f0 \u00de\u00bc a cos\u00f0 \u00dea 0 sin \u00f0 \u00dea 01 0 sin \u00f0 \u00dea 0 cos\u00f0 \u00dea 2 6 4 3 7 5; where ui,d is the azimuth and 0i,d is the zenith of the corresponding DOA, hi\u00f0x^t\u00de \u00bc x^t xi j x^t xi j jj ; hd\u00f0x^t\u00de \u00bc x^t xd jjx^t xdjj : \u00f04\u00de The azimuth u and zenith # of a Cartesian unit-length DOA vector h = [x, y, z] T can be determined by, \u00bc arc tan y x ; # \u00bc arc cosz: \u00f05\u00de The Nth-order spherical harmonics rotation matrix, R\u00f0N\u00de sp \u00f0x^t\u00de \u00bc R\u00f0N\u00de sp fRxyz\u00f0x^t\u00deg; \u00f06\u00de is determined from (3) by recurrence relations R\u00f0N\u00de sp fg according to [37].

Note that each participant has attended around six recordings [11]. Figures 2 and 1 show the correlation heatmap of features for different subjects, healthy individuals and patients respectively. Each data sample consists of 22 acoustic features (see Table1 for description of each feature) that can be divided into (1) MDVP features, extracted using the Kay Pentax Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP); (2) Standard features; (3) Non-standard features including the correlation dimension (D2), the recurrence period density entropy (RPDE) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA); (4) New pitch-based feature named Pitch Period Entropy (PPE) [12]. We employed different DL-based synthetic data generation techniques, including those proposed in [13]. In more detail, we used the VAE-based Deep Learning data generation techniques, which have been referred to as TVAE, CTGAN, or conditional generator [13] and CopulaGAN, which is a hybrid of the Gaussian Copula and the CTGAN algorithms, for generating data samples. Table3 lists the total samples for the healthy and PD classes and the quality scores of different methods. Note that the quality score evaluates how well synthetic data captures mathematical properties in original data and indicates that the TVAE method can generate high-quality data compared to the other two methods. \r\nDeveloping ML-based classifiers \r\nBased on recommendations in other studies [11, 5], we considered several traditional ML algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Decision Tree (DT), Extremely Randomized Trees or Extra Trees (ET) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We employed recursive feature elimination (RFE), which has suggested citeCai2018, Remeseiro2019, to select a subset of the most relevant features for the classification task that is classifying the speech features associated with patients from those that are related to healthy controls. RFE uses an ML algorithm (e.g., an SVM-based algorithm or an RF-based algorithm) as the learning algorithm and selects the optimal subset of features (i.e., the subset of features that are least essential features to be eliminated) based on the performance of the algorithm[14]. In our study, we considered an RF-based algorithm as the basis of our feature selection method, RFE and trained-validated the RF algorithm using 2 to 9 cross-fold validations. Figures 3, 4 and 5 describe the f1 score values from different sets of features for the datasets generated using the TVAE, CTGAN and CopulaGAN methods, respectively. We selected the number of cross-fold validations for each model that led to the most accurate classification results. The best f1 scores for the classifiers developed by the TVAE, CTGAN and CopulaGAN datasets using 5, 8 and 9 folds are around 0.83, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively. The classifiers achieved the accuracy mentioned above training with 17, 22 and 12 features, respectively.\r\nIn a simple way show me the data generation techniques being used here.\r\n",

[99][100][101] \r\nThe languages inherently Metis are either Metis French or a mixed language called Michif. Michif, Mechif, or Metchif is a phonetic spelling of Metif, a variant of Metis.[102] The Metis today predominantly speak English, with French as a strong second language, as well as numerous Aboriginal tongues. A 19th-century community of the Metis people, the Anglo-Metis, were referred to as Countryborn. They were children of Rupert\u2019s Land fur trade typically of Orcadian, Scottish, or English paternal descent and Aboriginal maternal descent.[103] Their first languages would have been Aboriginal (Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc.) and English. Their fathers spoke Gaelic, thus leading to the development of an English dialect referred to as \u201cBungee\u201d.[104] S.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 mentions the Metis yet there has long been debate over legally defining the term Metis,[105] but on September 23, 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Metis are a distinct people with significant rights (Powley ruling).[106] \r\nMetis \r\nMixed-blood fur trader, c. 1870 \r\nThe Metis are people descended from marriages between Europeans (mainly French) \r\n[95] and Cree, Ojibway, Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee, Mi\u2019kmaq, Maliseet, and other First Nations.[14] Their history dates to the mid-17th century.[3] When Europeans first arrived in Canada they relied on Aboriginal peoples for fur trading skills and survival. To ensure alliances, relationships between European fur traders and Aboriginal women were often consolidated through marriage.[96] The Metis\u2019 homeland consists of the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Ontario, as well as the Northwest Territories (NWT).[97] \r\nWarfare was common among Inuit groups with sufficient population density. Inuit, such as the Nunatamiut (Uummarmiut) who inhabited the Mackenzie River delta area, often engaged in common warfare. The Central Arctic Inuit lacked the population density to engage in warfare. In the 13th century, the Thule culture began arriving in Greenland from what is now Canada. \r\nNorse accounts are scant. Norse-made items from Inuit campsites in Greenland were obtained by either trade or plunder.[87] One account, Ivar Baroarson, speaks of \u201csmall people\u201d with whom the Norsemen fought.[88] 14th-century accounts that a western settlement, one of the two Norse settlements, was taken over by the Skraeling.[89] \r\nAfter the disappearance of the Norse colonies in Greenland, the Inuit had no contact with Europeans for at least a century. By the mid- 16th century, Basque fishers were already working the Labrador coast and had established whaling stations on land, such as been excavated at Red Bay.[90] The Inuit appear not to have interfered with their operations, but they did raid the stations in winter for tools, and particularly worked iron, which they adapted to native needs.[91] \r\nInuit \r\nThe Inuit are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule culture, which emerged from western Alaska around 1,000 CE and spread eastward across the Arctic, displacing the Dorset culture (in Inuktitut, the Tuniit). Inuit historically referred to the Tuniit as \r\n\u201cgiants\u201d Or \u201cdwarfs\u201d Who were taller and Stronger than the Inuit.[85] Researchers hypothesize that the Dorset culture lacked dogs, larger weapons, and other technologies used by the expanding Inuit society.[86] By 1300, the Inuit had settled in west Greenland, and finally moved into east Greenland over the following century. The Inuit had trade routes with more southern cultures. Boundary disputes were common and led to aggressive actions.[15] \r\nLnuk in a kayak, c. 1908-1914 \r\nMany Aboriginal civilizations[76] established characteristics and hallmarks that included permanent urban settlements or cities,[77] agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies.[78] These cultures had evolved and changed by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. Late 15th-early 16th centuries), and have been brought forward through archaeological investigations.[79] \r\nThere are indications of contact made before Christopher Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents. Aboriginal people in Canada interacted with Europeans around 1000 CE, but prolonged contact came after Europeans established permanent settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries.[80] European written accounts generally recorded the friendliness of the First Nations, who profited in trade with Europeans.[80] Such trade generally strengthened the more organized political entities such as the Iroquois Confederation.[81] Throughout the 16th century, European fleets made almost annual visits to the eastern shores of Canada to cultivate fishing opportunities. A side-line industry emerged in the unorganized traffic of furs overseen by the Indian Department.[82] \r\nThe Woodland cultural period dates from about 2,000 BCE-1,000 CE, and has locales in Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime regions.[71] The introduction of pottery distinguishes the Woodland culture from the earlier Archaic stage inhabitants. Laurentian people of southern Ontario manufactured the oldest pottery excavated to date in Canada.[60] They created pointed-bottom beakers decorated by a cord marking technique that involved impressing tooth implements into wet clay. Woodland technology included items such as beaver incisor knives, bangles, and chisels. The population practicing sedentary agricultural life ways continued to increase on a diet of squash, corn, and bean crops.[60] \r\nThe Hopewell tradition is an Aboriginal culture that flourished along American rivers from 300 BCE-500 CE. To its greatest extent, the Hopewell Exchange System networked cultures and societies with the people on the Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Canadian expression of the Hopewellian peoples encompasses the Point Peninsula, Saugeen, and Laurel complexes.[72][73][74] \r\nFirst Nations \r\nChief George from the village of Senakw with his daughter in traditional regalia, c. 1906 \r\nFirst Nations peoples had settled and established trade routes across what is now Canada by 500 BCE-1,000 CE. Communities developed each with Its own culture, customs, and character.[75] In the northwest were the Athapaskan, Slavey, Dogrib, Tutchone, and Tlingit. Along the Pacific coast were the \r\nTsimshian; Haida; Salish; Kwakiutl; Heiltsuk; Nootka; Nisga\u2019a; Senakw and Gitxsan. In the plains were the Blackfoot; Kafnawa; Sarcee and Peigan. In the northern woodlands were the Cree and Chipewyan. Around the Great Lakes were the Anishinaabe; Algonquin; Iroquois and Huron. Along the Atlantic coast were the Beothuk, Maliseet, lnnu, Abenaki, and Mi\u2019kmaq. \r\nThule site (Copper Inuit) near the waters of Cambridge Bay (Victoria Island) \r\nThe west coast of Canada by 7,000-5000 BCE (9,000-7,000 years ago) saw various cultures that organized themselves around salmon fishing. (65] The Nuu-chah-nulth of Vancouver Island began whaling with advanced long spears at about this time.[65] The Maritime Archaic is one group of North America\u2019s Archaic culture of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic. They prospered from approximately 7,000 BCE-1,500 BCE (9,000-3,500 years ago) along the Atlantic Coast of North America. (66] Their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped. \r\nTemporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in long-distance trade, using as currency white chert, a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine.[67] The Pre-Columbian culture, whose members were called Red Paint People, is indigenous to the New England and Atlantic Canada regions of North America. The culture flourished between 3,000 BCE-1,000 BCE (5,000-3,000 years ago) and was named after their burial ceremonies, which used large quantities of red ochre to cover bodies and Grave goods. (68) \r\nPost-Archaic periods \r\nA northerly section focusing on the Saugeen, Laurel, and Point Peninsula complexes of the map showing the southeastern United States and the Great Lakes area of Canada showing the Hopewell Interaction Sphere and in different colors the various local expressions of the Hopewell cultures, including the Laurel Complex, Saugeen Complex, Point Peninsula Complex, Marksville culture, Copena culture, Kansas City Hopewell, Swift Creek Culture, Goodall Focus, Crab Orchard culture, and Havana Hopewell culture. \r\nThe Old Copper Complex societies dating from 3,000 BCE-500 BCE (5,000-2,500 years ago) \r\nAre a manifestation of the Woodland Culture, and are pre-pottery in nature.[70] Evidence found in the northern Great Lakes regions indicates that they extracted copper from local glacial deposits and used it in its natural form to manufacture tools and implements.[70] \r\nThe Arctic small tool tradition is a broad cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500 BCE (4,500 years ago).[69] These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as a side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. Scrapers, engraving tools, and adze blades were also included in their toolkits.[69] The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of the Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit in the 1000 Common Era (CE).[69]:179-81 \r\nThe placement of artifacts and materials within an Archaic burial site indicated social differentiation based on status.[58] There is a continuous record of occupation of S\u2019oIh Temexw by Aboriginal people dating from the early Holocene period, 10,000-9,000 years ago. [62] Archaeological sites at Stave Lake, Coquitlam Lake, Fort Langley, and the region uncovered early-period artifacts. These early inhabitants \r\nwere highly mobile hunter-gatherers, consisting of about 20 to 50 members of an extended family.[62][verification needed] The Na-Dene people occupied much of the land area of northwest and central North America starting around 8,000 BCE.[63] They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples, including the Navajo and Apache. They had villages with large multi-family dwellings, used seasonally during the summer, from which they hunted, fished, and gathered food supplies for the winter.[64] The Wendat peoples settled in Southern Ontario along the Eramosa River around 8,000-7,000 BCE (10,000-9,000 years ago).[65] They were concentrated between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay. Wendat hunted caribou to survive on the glacier-covered land. [65] Many different First Nations cultures relied upon the buffalo starting by 6,000-5,000 BCE (8,000-7,000 years ago).[65] They hunted buffalo by herding migrating buffalo off cliffs. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, near Lethbridge, Alberta, is a hunting ground that was in use for about 5,000 years.[65] The Plano culture was a group of huntergatherer communities that occupied the Great Plains area of North America between 12,000- 10,000 years ago.[56] The Paleo-Indians moved into new territory as it emerged from under the glaciers. The big game flourished in this new environment.[57] The Plano culture is characterized by a range of projectile point tools collectively called Plano points, which were used to hunt bison. Their diets also included pronghorn, elk, deer, raccoon, and coyote.[56] At the beginning of the Archaic Era, they began to adopt a sedentary approach to subsistence.[56] Sites in and around Belmont, Nova Scotia have evidence of Plano-Indians, indicating small seasonal hunting camps, perhaps re-visited over generations from around 11,000-10,000 years ago.[56] Seasonal large and smaller game fish and fowl were food and raw material sources. Adaptation to the harsh environment included tailored clothing and skin-covered tents on wooden frames.[56]\r\nCorrect the wrong spellings in the file and remove the number from the brackets and the square brackets.\r\n",

It is said that when a Chakravartin dies - because a Chakravartin happens only in thousands of years, he is a rare being - when he dies he is received in heaven with great rejoicing and he is taken to a special place. When a Chakravartin dies he is led to Sumeru to engrave his name on it. Of course this man was immensely excited that he was going to write his name on Sumeru. That is the ultimate catalog of all the great ones that have been, and will also be the catalog of all the great ones who are going to be. The gatekeeper gave him the instruments to engrave his name. He wanted to take a few of his men who had committed suicide just because their emperor was dying. The emperor wanted the gatekeeper to let them all come to see him engrave his name. The gatekeeper said, \"You listen to my advice, because this is my inherited profession. My father was a gatekeeper, his father was a gatekeeper, for centuries we have been gatekeepers to Sumeru . Listen to my advice: Don't take them with you; other wise you will repent.\" The emperor could not understand, but neither could he ignore the advice. The gatekeeper said, \"If you still want them to see, first go engrave your name; then come back and take them with you if you want. The emperor said, \"That's good I will go alone, engrave my name, come back, and call you all\". The emperor went and he saw the Sumeru shining under thousands of suns-because in heaven you cannot be so poor as to have just one one. And then he started looking for a space, the right space, but he was very much puzzled; there was no space; the whole mountain was engraved with name. He could not believe his eyes. For the first time he became aware what he was. Up to now he was thinking he was a superman who happens once in thousands of years. But time has been from eternity; even thousands of years don't make any difference, so many Chakravartins had happened already. There was no space on that biggest mountain in the whole universe where he could write his small name. He came back and took the gatekeeper aside and said, \"But there is no space!\". The gatekeeper said, \"That's what I was telling you. What you have to do is to erase a few name and write down your name. That's what has been done; my whole life I have been seeing this done. Whenever a Chakravartin has come he had to erase a few names and write his own name. So this is not the whole history of the Chakravartins. Many times it has been erased, many times it has been engraved. You must do your work, and then if you want to show your friends you can bring them in.\" The emperor said, \"No, I don't want to show them and I don't want to even write my name. What's the point? - someday somebody will come and erase it. My whole life has become utterly meaningless. For this I have lived, for this I have staked my life; for this I was ready to kill the whole world. And anybody else can erase my name and write his. What is the point of writing it? I will not write it.\" Please tell me what Sumeru is and also tell me what life lessons this story teach us.",

A socialistic ambition, as pure and well-intentioned it may be, is ineffective if it is not complemented with managerial efficiency i.e. the \u2018how\u2019 of governance.\r\nAlthough various commissions have provided solutions to reform administrative machinery, they have not been implemented in spirit by different governments of the day. These reforms - structural, procedural, attitudinal, and psychological are as under.:\r\nProcedural Reforms\r\nSensitivity training: For example: In Jan Maitri project, introduced by Kerela Police Department policemen are shown visuals of common man\u2019s desperation in their training period.\r\nLateral entries: For example. Appointing Sam Pitroda, Nandan Nilekani type, out of the box thinkers from private sector who can think globally and act locally.\r\nQuantified Performance measurement benchmarks and Objective Appraisals: e.g. 360 degree appraisals which values consumer feedback and subordinate opinion as well. ACR be replaced with APAR which unlike ACR is non confidential and aims at hand holding subordinates rather than \u2018controlling\u2019 them.\r\n\r\nStructural Reforms\r\nOne stop grievance redressal mechanism: For e.g. Aayakar Sewa Kendras bought in by Income Tax department.\r\nDigitization of procedures: Implementing ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning like SAP). This Business Process Re Engineering will result in quick, holistic, informed decision making that too in real time. It can track business resources\u2014 cash, raw materials, production capacity and the status of service delivery\r\nCitizen Participation in Governance: Regular Jan Sabhas, Social Audits, will bring in transparency, innovative and targeted solutions, stakeholder mentality where in people don\u2019t consider themselves as passive beneficiaries but as active contributors.\r\nLegal Reforms\r\nAmend Article 311 of the constitution that gives enormous discretion, immunity to civil servants.\r\nHave a mid career examination and performance review. Poor performers should be allowed to leave. No officer has the right to hold an office of public importance indefinitely just because he cleared some examination many years ago.\r\nStrengthen \u2018Prevention of Corrutption Act\u2019-1988, to include collusive corruption in it.\r\nStreamline, rationalise conduct rules. Revoke provisions of over regulation. like requirement for attestation from a gazetted officer, etc. as was rightfully accomplished recently.\r\nCode of ethics would go a long way in building a motivated work force in wake of an unpredictable, complex, changing environment.\r\nAll states should enact Lokayukta act in consonance with U.N. declaration against corruption of which India is a signatory.\r\nForm a Civil Service Board as in Maharashtra to reduce political interference in official appointments, promotions which will reduce nepotism, sycophancy, corruption in government.\r\nReforms in Bureaucratic Mindset\r\nOfficials should think of themselves as servants and not masters. For example. Julious Robero, Kiran Bedi, Prakash Singh (all of them President award winners).\r\nBuild qualities of empathy, kindness, courage to stand up against powerful lobbies. For e.g. Kautilya\u2019s vision of an ideal Sachiv(officer).\r\nOur final aim should be less government and more governance. In words of Mr. Narayana Murthy-\u201cIndian Civil Service (ICS) was replaced by Indian Administrative Service (IAS) post independence. Now time has come when we replace Indian Administrative Service with Indian Management Service (IMS)\u201d.\r\nChanges In Economy And Business\r\nApart from improving public service delivery, the above mentioned reforms will also improve our Ease of Doing Business ranking which presently stands poorly at 130/189 as per World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Report (2016). An informal discussion with an average Indian businessman will reveal difficulty of doing business in India. As many functions in a business that many regulators are in govt \u2013 labour inspections, emission watch by NGT, construction monitoring by muncipalities, Forex regulations by RBI, equity market by SEBI, taxation by I.T, Sales tax dept, CBEC,etc, and so on. Furthermore, there are legal hurdles- delays in land acquisition, federal issues, fuel supply shortage, sluggish freight movement, poor infrastructure, no buyer\u2019s protection. In each of these sub sectors we need a change. Labour Reforms from Rajasthan, time bound, transparent land acquisition from Gujrat, reliable procurement of electricity as in Chattisgarh, robust credit supply as in Maharashtra, seamless mines to industry to market to consumer connectivity as in Gujarat west coast, one stop clearances as in Telangana\u2019s innovative Right to Clearance, effective dispute resolution mechanism and minimum labour unrest as in Punjab. Solutions are scattered. Centre should be a facilitator in integrating these dispersed solutions and fitting them as per local requirements. This will flourish Make in India campaign harnessing our demographic dividend and pushing us at par with China type economies.\r\nIndustrial reforms also mean venturing into new sunrise sectors, going beyond textiles, jewellery, I.T and finance,. Sectors like Food Processing hold an immense potential as they have a forward and backward linkage impact benefitting farmers, consumers and economy as a whole. Similarly, Tourism, being labour intensive, local, traditionally exposed, sector that too requiring minimum capital investment in a geographically gifted country like ours is a blessing we have not availed so far. Likewise, Education sector too holds a promise. India can create a cadre of \u2018Indian Education Service\u2019 which will export teachers to the world capturing the minds of people into local tunes and this will be real victory that no hard power can beat. India will restore its status of \u2018Jagat Guru\u2019 once again, in post Asokan era as envisaged by Swami Vivekananda.\r\n\r\nSummarize it in tables, with two colums \u2013 Categories and Changes. \r\n",

    "Prompt": "The study of massive vector boson scattering (VBS), \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 \u2192 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc4a, \ud835\udc4d),1 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) probes the mechanism of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking (EWSB) in the Standard Model (SM), and provides unique sensitivity for new physics phenomena that affect the gauge sector [1\u20133]. In the SM, couplings to the Higgs boson prevent the divergence of longitudinally polarised VBS amplitudes at high energies and unitarity violation at the TeV scale [4\u20137]. In proton\u2212proton (\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5d) collisions, VBS at leading order (LO) involves two initial quarks, each of which radiates a vector boson. The two bosons subsequently interact and then decay. The two outgoing quarks fragment usually close to the beam direction. The final state consists of two vector bosons and two jets (\ud835\udc57), \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57, and can also be produced from non-VBS processes.\r\nThe production of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 at LO has contributions both from modes that involve only the EW-interaction vertices (EW \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57) and from modes that involve the strong interaction (quantum chromodynamics, QCD) vertices (QCD \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57). Representative LO Feynman diagrams for EW \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The leading QCD \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 diagrams are shown in Figure 3, where the two diagrams with gluons in the initial state are forbidden when there are two \ud835\udc4a bosons with the same electric charge produced, \ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57. The EW production is further categorised into two components. The first component is EW VBS production (see Figure 1), which involves the actual scattering of the two vector bosons. The scattering occurs via triple or quartic gauge vertices, the \ud835\udc60- or \ud835\udc61-channel exchange of a Higgs boson or a \ud835\udc4a/\ud835\udc4d/\ud835\udefe boson. The diagrams with bosons in the \ud835\udc60-channel, shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(d), are forbidden in the SM for \ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 final states. The diagram in Figure 1(d) is possible in extensions of the SM with a doubly charged Higgs boson. The second component is EW non-VBS production (see Figure 2) with EW vertices only, where the two bosons do not interact. The EW non-VBS component cannot be separated from the EW VBS component in a gauge-invariant way and is therefore considered as a contribution to the signal. Triboson production where one boson decays hadronically also results in the \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 final state. These processes only contain EW interactions and are separable in a gauge-invariant manner [8]. The resonant decay of a boson into two quarks can be suppressed by applying a requirement on the invariant d\u0133et mass \ud835\udc5ajj arising from the two quarks. As a consequence, triboson processes are suppressed in the EW VBS phase-space region. The \ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 final state has the largest ratio of electroweak to strong production cross sections among final states sensitive to VBS diboson processes [3]; this is because quark\u2013gluon and gluon\u2013gluon initiated diagrams are absent at LO accuracy in perturbative QCD and contributions from quark and (anti-)quark annihilation diagrams are suppressed. This production ratio is of order five in the fiducial phase-space region of the analysis. The \ud835\udc60-channel VBS diagrams with trilinear interactions are absent in the \ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 final state. In addition, electroweak diagrams not involving self interactions are suppressed [9], which enhances the sensitivity of this final state to gauge-boson self couplings.\r\n\ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 scattering where both \ud835\udc4a bosons decay leptonically (into \ud835\udc52\ud835\udf08 or \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf08, collectively denoted by \u2113\ud835\udf08) is a sensitive process for studying VBS, since the electric charges of \ud835\udc4a bosons can be determined directly from leptons. The final state consists of two leptons with the same electric charge, two neutrinos, and two jets with a large rapidity separation. The requirement of the presence of two leptons with the same electric charge significantly reduces SM backgrounds coming from top\u2013anti-top quark pair production (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u00af) and \ud835\udc4d + jets events. Previously, an observation of EW \ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 production was reported by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations [10, 11]. More recently, the CMS Collaboration published an updated measurement using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb\u22121 [12]. This paper presents fiducial and differential EW and inclusive \ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 production cross section measurements at \u221a \ud835\udc60 = 13 TeV using 139 fb\u22121 of data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The results are extended here to include the differential cross sections of EW \ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc57 production. There are several changes with respect to the previous ATLAS result [11]. The current measurement uses improved baseline signal modelling, implements a tighter veto on additional leptons, includes a charge selector tool based on boosted decision trees for rejecting electron candidates where the charge is likely misidentified, employs a data-driven extraction of the \ud835\udc5ajj shape of the \ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc4d background, and incorporates updates to the estimation of non-prompt lepton background.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s VV and \ud835\udc4a\u00b1\ud835\udc4a\u00b1 in this paper?

    "Prompt": "The Belle experiment ran at the KEKB e +e \u2212 asymmetric energy collider at the KEK Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan between 1999 to 2010[13\u201315] . A large part of data samples at Belle were recorded on or near the \u03a5(4S) resonance, where copious BB\u00af pairs used to study the B physics are produced. In addition, Belle collected a series of special data sets at \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S), and \u03a5(10860) resonances. The data samples recorded at Belle are detailed in Table 1 [16] . The total integrated luminosity reaches approximately 1 ab\u22121 . All of the data sets were used to explore the hadron spectroscopy, and a large number of new conventional quarkonia and some exotic hadrons were found using these samples.\r\nBelle is constantly enriching the hadron spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1 [17] , many quarkonium(-like) states were observed at Belle, including long-term missing conventional quarkonia and new exotic hadrons of X, Y , Zc, and Zb states. In the following, we introduce three outstanding achievements on exotic hadrons at Belle.\r\nIn 2003, Belle observed a narrow charmonium-like state decaying into \u03c0 +\u03c0 \u2212J/\u03c8 with a mass of (3872.0\u00b10.8) MeV/c 2 in B \u00b1 \u2192 K\u00b1\u03c0 +\u03c0 \u2212J/\u03c8[5] . This is the first state with unconventional charmonium properties, thus opening a new era for studying of exotic hadrons. The X(3872) was subsequently confirmed by several other experiments [18\u201320] . The J P C = 1++ was determined by LHCb by performing a five-dimensional angular correlation analysis in B decays [21] . So far X(3872) is still one of the most interesting exotic meson candidates because of its unexpected properties as follows. The mass of X(3872) is close to the DD\u00af(\u2217) threshold, and its width is very narrow. Such property is very different from the excited \u03c8 states, such as \u03c8(3770), \u03c8(4040), and \u03c8(4160), which decays into D (\u2217)D\u00af(\u2217) with large branching fractions, but their widths are very large. The enhancement of isospin-violating J/\u03c8\u03c1 decay was observed. Very recently, Belle determined that the lower limit on the DD\u00af \u2217 coupling constant is 0.094 at 90% credibility level, which implies the partial width of DD\u00af \u2217 in X(3872) decays is much larger than those of J/\u03c8\u03c1, J/\u03c8\u03c9, and radiative decay modes [22] . Searching for charged charmonium-like states is one of the most promising ways in studying exotic hadrons, since such a state must contain at least four quarks and thus cannot be a conventional quark-antiquark meson. The first charged charmonium-like state, Zc(4430)\u00b1, was reported in the \u03c0 \u00b1\u03c8(2S) mass spectrum in B \u2192 K\u03c0\u00b1\u03c8(2S) decays at Belle in 2007[8] . It was not confirmed by LHCb until seven years later [9] . Unlike Zc(4430)\u00b1, Zc(3900) state decaying into \u03c0 \u00b1J/\u03c8 was observed simultaneously by BESIII and Belle [10,11] . The Zc(4200)+ \u2192 \u03c0 +J/\u03c8 with J P = 1+ was observed by performing an amplitude analysis of B\u00af0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K\u2212\u03c0 + decays in four dimensions by Belle [23] , which has been confirmed by LHCb[24] . In comparison with the number of charmonium-like states from PDG[6] , the number of bottomonium-like states is smaller due to lower production rates and limited experimental conditions. Up to now, only two bottomonium-like states were observed: Zb(10610) and Zb(10650). They were discovered by Belle only using \u03a5(5S) on-resonance and scan data samples [12,25\u201328] . The Zb(10610)+ and Zb(10650)+ can decay into \u03c0 +\u03a5(nS) (n = 1, 2, 3), \u03c0 +hb(mP) (m = 1, 2), and B (\u2217)+B\u00af\u22170 [12,25\u201327] . The decay modes of Zb(10610)+ \u2192 B +B\u00af\u22170 and Zb(10650)+ \u2192 B \u2217+B\u00af\u22170 are dominant[27] . The neutral partner of the Zb(10610)+ was observed as well in its \u03c0 0\u03a5(2S) and \u03c0 0\u03a5(3S) decay modes [28] .\r\n\r\nUse this to create a media speech.

    "Prompt": "Create a twitter thread with this data:\r\n\r\nLight pseudoscalars that couple to Higgs bosons appear in many well-motivated new physics scenarios. A few examples of such scenarios are the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model [1], axion models [2, 3], and models with dark or extended Higgs sectors [4\u20136]. In addition, they may be related to a possible muon \ud835\udc54 \u2212 2 deviation with respect to the Standard Model (SM) predicted value, e.g. as in Ref. [7]. The search for elusive particles in the decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson [8, 9] is a highly promising avenue for their discovery. Due to the narrow decay width of the Higgs boson [10], even minor contributions from physics beyond the SM can result in final states with significant branching fractions. The most recent combination of the ATLAS measurements of the Higgs boson production rates does not rule out decays to yet unobserved states with a branching ratio of up to 12% [11] at 95% confidence level (CL). The corresponding result from the CMS experiment is 16% [12]. These results indicate that there may be sizeable exotic decays of the Higgs bosons that have not been observed yet. The LHC experiments have looked for such particles in Higgs boson decays, usually assuming that the Higgs boson, \ud835\udc3b, decays to a pair of narrow-width, pseudoscalar particles \ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e), which subsequently decay to fermions or photons. Such searches have been performed in the \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 [13, 14], 4\ud835\udc4f [15, 16], 4\ud835\udf07 [17, 18], \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf0f or 4\ud835\udf0f [19\u201324], \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf0f [25], 4\ud835\udefe [26, 27] and 2\ud835\udefe + 2 jets [28] final states. In addition to the \ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e channel, the decay mode of \ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4e is well-motivated, but remains less studied. Such decays are particularly motivated by axion models [2]. This decay has been searched for by ATLAS in the case where the \ud835\udc4d boson decays to leptons and \ud835\udc4e decays to jets [29], but this is one of the first searches for the \ud835\udc3b \u2192 \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc4e with \ud835\udc4e \u2192 \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe. In this letter, results from the search for the final state in which the \ud835\udc4d boson decays to leptons and the \ud835\udc4e particle decays to a photon pair are presented using the full LHC Run 2 proton\u2013proton (\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5d) collision data collected by the ATLAS detector during 2015\u20132018 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\u22121 . The search explores \ud835\udc4e particle masses, \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e, between 0.1 GeV and 33 GeV. When the invariant mass of the two photons from the \ud835\udc4e decay is below 2 GeV and the transverse momentum of the diphoton system is high, their electromagnetic showers typically overlap in the detector and a single photon is reconstructed. The search presented here considers both the merged and the resolved \ud835\udc4e \u2192 \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe decays. This letter is structured as follows. A description of the ATLAS detector is given in Section 2, followed by a presentation of the data and simulated samples in Section 3. The physics object reconstruction is discussed in Section 4, followed by an explanation of the analysis in Section 5, the presentation of the search results in Section 6 and the conclusion in Section 7.\r\n\r\nMax thread \u2013 5.\r\n",

They assumed that society is self-regulating and that the socioeconomic system is able to run smoothly with little interference from the government. Economy, decentralization, and freedom from governmental control were the classical liberal\u2019s main concerns, as shown particularly clearly in the writings of John Stuart Mill. They accepted the necessity of maintaining defense but postulated the existence of a basic harmony of interests among states, which would minimize the incidence of wars. Economic cooperation based upon an international division of labour and upon free trade would be in the interests of everybody\u2014commerce would be the great panacea, the rational substitute for war.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of wars that did occur, however, liberals emphasized a variety of factors. First, they focused on autocratic governments, which were presumed to wage war against the wishes of peacefully inclined people. It thus became a major tenet of liberal political philosophy that war could be eliminated by introducing universal suffrage because the people would surely vote out of office any belligerently inclined government. From the early American pamphleteer Thomas Paine onward, a major school of liberals supported republicanism and stressed the peaceful impact of public opinion. Although they could not agree about actual policies, they stressed certain general ideas concerning relations between states, paralleling their laissez-faire ideas of the internal organization of the state with ideas of a minimum amount of international organization, use of force strictly limited to repelling aggression, the importance of public opinion and of democratically elected governments, and rational resolution of conflicts and disputes. Later in the course of the 19th century, however, and especially after World War I, liberals began to accept the conclusion that an unregulated international society did not automatically tend toward peace and advocated international organization as a corrective.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of wars that did occur,In this para waht factors liberals emphasize? and did liberals accept the conclusion or not?",

    "Prompt": "The ToO sources of interest for EUSO-SPB2 include galactic and extra-galactic supernovae, binary neutron star mergers, neutron star-black hole mergers, nearby tidal disruption events, flaring blazars, gamma-ray bursts, and other transients (see Fig. 2). It has long been theorized that sources such as these may produce VHE neutrinos, and discoveries such as that of IceCube-170922A in which a neutrino of energy between 0.1-1 PeV was detected in association with a flaring blazar, have further motivated these searches [2]. The transients listed above all offer a chance of neutrino detection to varying degrees. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers may result in rapidly-spinning magnetars that can accelerate particles with ultra-high energies. These accelerated UHECRs may then produce neutrinos through interactions with the surrounding environment [7, 8]. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) accrete material and produce a flare of radiation that can last from months to years. Some TDEs result in powerful, relativistic jets which may act as proton and nuclei accelerators capable of reaching ultra-high energies and producing VHE and ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos [9, 10]. Blazar flares and active galactic nuclei can produce ultra-high energy neutrinos through the interaction of accelerated cosmic rays with photon and baryon backgrounds [11, 12]. Supermassive binary black hole (BBH) mergers may also accelerate still-present material to ultra-high energies which would produce neutrinos through interactions with the surrounding environment, though the potential for these jets is still disputed [7, 13]. Short duration transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), may also produce ultra high energy neutrinos [14, 15]. However, due to their short duration and small radiation zone, their strong magnetic fields and radiation backgrounds may limit the maximum energies of transient neutrinos to the EeV range or below [16].\r\nToO Catalog for EUSO-SPB2\r\nWith the goal of optimizing the scientific reach of the ToO program within the operational parameters of the EUSO-SPB2 mission, a catalog of sources was developed from the three preexisting alert systems broadcast from various observatories and instruments. The ToO catalog is populated through a combination of manual and automated processes that parsed alerts from the Gamma-ray Coordination Network (GCN), the Transient Name Server (TNS), and the Astronomer\u2019s Telegram (ATel) are monitored and sorted based on their relation to potential neutrino sources of interest. GCN and TNS alerts are sorted by a python script, and ATel alerts are sorted by hand. The catalog also includes a list of hand-selected steady sources (Fig. 3). For the EUSO-SPB2 observation period on May 14, 2023, the ToO catalog contained 152 sources, including 16 sources from GCN, 12 sources from TNS, 4 sources from ATels, and 120 steady sources. Each catalog (ToO) entry includes the reported observation time and observation coordinates of the alert. If the information is available via the respective alert system, the redshift and other characteristics are calculated and included in the catalog entry. Next, each source is assigned a priority value. These priority values are assigned based on the scheme presented in Section 3. From this information, the time each ToO enters the detector\u2019s field of view on a given night can then be calculated. ToO observations are scheduled for each nightly period of possible CT operation based on the values included in their catalog entries. More information on this scheduling process can be found in [17, 18]. A user interface that was developed for the ToO mission, so that shifters could manually enter new source alert information at the time of observation if an alert of high priority was issued during the current observation run. This manual process calculates the time and CT pointing direction needed to catch the source and adds the information to the ToO observing schedule for the current observation run.\r\nWhat is IceCube-170922A in this paper.

    "Prompt": "Act like you are Martin Luther King Jr but instead of human rights activist, you are a socialist. Turn this into a fiery speech just the way he would have given:\r\n\r\nIn last week of February 2016, news of hepatitis C patients protesting outside India\u2019s patent office in New Delhi was splashed across all major national newspapers in India. The patients were protesting against the American multinational pharmaceutical major Gilead Sciences and the United States government for pressuring the Indian government \u201cto blindly and speedily grant patents\u201d to Gilead\u2019s exorbitantly priced drug named Sovaldi, whose generic versions manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in India are used by millions of hepatitis C patients across the world. So who are these multinational corporations that can even influence sovereign governments and impact millions of lives in the process? The term \u2018Multinational Corporations\u2019 (or MNCs) refers to companies that have operations and offices in multiple countries even though headquartered in only one or few of them. Even though the term itself may be of modern origin, such MNCs have existed at least for the past four to five centuries. East India Company, the English trading company that grew its influence in India in the 17th century and laid the foundations of English rule in India, can easily be classified as one.\r\nIn today\u2019s globalised and increasingly interconnected world such companies are only increasing their tribe. Exchange of goods, services, ideas, labor etc. are being encouraged worldwide; specialization is being touted as the need of the hour and increasingly more and more companies are spreading their influence outside their country of origin. While one country may be specialized in manufacturing of certain types of goods using patented technology, others may have abundant supply of qualified human resources or cheap labor along with market for selling the finished goods. Therefore such difference in availability of resources, skills, markets etc., caused not only by geo-political reasons but by historical reasons like imperialism and colonialism, has meant that companies today are increasingly looking to have a global footprint. Most of the major MNCs today are headquartered in the industrial or developed countries. These companies, armed with the latest technology and surplus capital, are mainly looking towards the markets in less developed and developing economies to expand their operations. A number of MNCs are operating all over the world today. In India, MNCs like Standard Chartered, HSBC, Colgate-Palmolive, Castrol etc., to name a few, have been operating for decades now. However such multinational corporations can be both, a boon as well as a bane, especially for the less developed or developing countries and for a number of reasons which we will be discussing.\r\nMultinational corporations bring with them capital to invest in developing countries. Such capital can be of utmost use in developing economies where capital is scarce and where tremendous growth opportunities exists. Therefore it becomes a win-win situation for both the MNCs and the developing countries as MNCs can deploy their surplus capital for good returns, whereas, the receiving country can expect a boost to its economic growth. However, quick and mass repatriation of such capital in volatile times can be equally harmful to the economy of the developing country. The East Asian crisis of 1997 caused due to such flight of foreign capital from Thailand, South Korea, and Indonesia etc is a good example. Similarly, usage of tax havens to avoid payment of taxes and \u2018transfer pricings\u2019 are also major sources of financial loss caused by MNCs to the developing countries. In recent studies it was also found that majority of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) being received from developed world was only a reinvestment of profits by the MNCs and their investors and not a deployment of fresh capital. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the share of reinvested earnings is reported to have accounted for as much as four-fifths of total outflows in 2014 for select developed countries. UNCTAD also underlined the large amount of losses to the exchequer of developing countries ($100 billion a year) due to the routing of FDI through tax havens.\r\nAnother way in which these MNCs can boost the economy of developing countries is via the introduction of state-of-the-art technology that can increase productivity and efficiency while making available better and cost effective products to the customers. However, at the same time, danger persists of some companies bringing in obsolete technology and flooding the market with low quality and potentially harmful goods. If proper care is not taken to enforce modern regulatory standards, poor technology can even lead to industrial accidents, environmental degradation etc. causing severe loss of lives while impacting future generations. India has been on the receiving end of such a disaster in the form of the Bhopal gas tragedy of 1984 where leakage of methyl isocyanate from a pesticide plant of Union Carbide, an MNC, caused tremendous loss of lives, and scarring even the future unborn generations of Bhopal.\r\n\r\n",

The use of social media has now become so important for the new generation that it has become an addiction that is difficult to recognize, so in this contrast, the older generation feels a sense of satisfaction and contentment at having been born in an era when something other than technology defined the social and recreational lives of the children of that time. We are attempting to become more socialized through media, yet the media is expanding, and individuals are essentially being trapped within a room. The younger generation is entirely relied on social media. Social media is basically the primary source of getting information in the present scenario while in the 90\u2019s newspapers were the primary source of information. Reading the newspaper is a habit that our parents have instilled in us. The primary source of reliable news was regarded as newspapers and television news. Doordarshan was the most famous and reliable TV channel in the 90\u2019s, compared to the 24-hour news networks of today, which lack any meaningful content and are occupied with playing outside in the real world. Social media is basically an outcome of technological advancements.\r\n\r\nEvery technological advancement brings advantages along with disappointments. It is on the awareness of the users how advantages can be maximized, and disadvantages minimized. 90\u2019s is the time when there was no Internet and single-screen theaters were common. So, circumstances at that point were not conducive for the growth of social media. Rotary landline phones were found in every home feature, phones were considered a luxury, and our identity was determined by what we did in the real world. The 90\u2019s generation often feel an awkward generation gap with younger generations. Social media created a virtual word which runs parallel to the real word. In contrast if we talk about socialization then there are two kinds of socialization that exist the one is real socialization and other is the virtual socialization. Technological innovation brought with itself the heat of change. A person who is able to adopt the stream of change will survive and advanced in future.\r\n\r\nWe molded ourself with change in time and time advanced with technology. We also adapted to ourself with changing technology and evolving social media life. Simple landline advanced in to cellular phones and it gives way to multimedia phones which ultimately culminated in to proliferation of smart phones. The origin of smart phones has given way to social media advancement.\r\n\r\nImpact of social media we can observe in every sphere of life. Social media is used by the people for popularity. Ministers, Bureaucrats and several higher ranked government officials are proactively using social sites and social media to popularize their works and trying to establish themself as highly efficient professionals who are working more efficiently as an administrator to resolve the suffering of others. While the main purpose of using social media to popularize himself as an efficient administrator because it will be beneficial for them as per future is concern.\r\n\r\nBillions of people are now creating and sharing massive amounts of data with one another. This gives people a sense of being associated instead of feeling lonely. When you consider developing a social media strategy for your company, the following platforms are likely to spring to mind: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube etc.\r\n\r\nRewrite this essay in terms of life without social media.",

    "Prompt": "Rationality promotes scientific temperament in the individual. Scientific temperament enables people to raise the question of what exists in the universe. Scientific invention, discovery and exploration are all the outcome of human rationality. Rationalism is the very fundamental essence of humanity. When the light of rationality illuminates the human brain, intellectualism takes birth. The rise of rationalism is the renaissance which happened during the 14th to 17th century in Europe.\r\nFollowing the Middle Ages, Europe had a passionate era of cultural, artistic, political, and economic \"rebirth\" during the Renaissance. The Renaissance, often seen as occurring between the 14th and the 17th centuries, fostered the rediscovery of ancient philosophy, literature, and art. The Renaissance was basically the rise of rationalism. Every intellectual perspective became more visible under the illumination of rationalism.\r\nArticle 51 A(h), of the Fundamental Duties (FDs) which was introduced in the Indian constitution in the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act,1976. It is the responsibility of every Indian citizen to develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform. The spirit of inquiry is basically promoting rationalism in human beings. If we want to know the reality of the universe or cosmos, then our approach should be rational. The truths about who we are, the world we live in, and the cosmos may be discovered if we think logically and rationally. Truth and reason go hand in hand. It is not possible to imagine one exist without the other.\r\nRationality is continually looking for reality, and reality can only be found in the light of rationality. The Indian legal system is based on the principle of rationality. Judges attempt to make judgements based on evidence rather than preconceived notions, emotions, and sentiments. Rationality serves as the standard by which reality is evaluated. Rationality is continually trying to give truth the upper hand and truth is real. Thus, what is rational is also real, and vice versa.\r\nRational people may attain their life objectives by having the ability to control their thoughts and conduct. They have the self-control to avoid engaging in unhealthy life habits such as drinking alcohol or disordered eating, and they are able to make rational judgments without letting their emotions affect them. A logical mind constantly thinks calmly, attentively, and objectively. It may be said that everyone with a rational mind has this as their ultimate goal. If you consistently participate in rational thinking, you can base your conclusions on facts and evidence. Using reason, you can recognize bad conceptions and practices.\r\nWe may better comprehend ourselves and those of others who surround us by using rational thought. It can also help us succeed since we can comprehend realities regarding true desires instead of becoming sidetracked or behaving unreasonably. Although full objectivity will never exist, logical thought is still possible. As far as objectivity is concerned, rationality encourages individuals to make informed decisions. Setting feasible micro and macro goals is the fundamental indicator of being rational, and one should be proud of one's capacity for logical thought. If you want to succeed, you must be rational.\r\nRewrite this essay with the laws of UAE and change the context as per their law.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "I need help with derivation of equations in the below paragraph. Also write summary on Emergent String Conjecture keeping the context in mind.\r\n\r\nRecent explorations of moduli spaces in quantum gravity have uncovered evidence of universal structures within infinite-distance limits. As pointed out long ago by Ooguri and Vafa [1], such limits seem to feature a tower of light particles, whose masses decay exponentially with geodesic distance ||\u03d5|| as m \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b1||\u03d5||). Such a tower of light particles implies that quantum gravity becomes strongly coupled at an energy scale \u039bQG (often referred to as the \u201cspecies scale\u201d) which is parametrically smaller than the Planck scale, and which itself decays as \u039bQG \u223c exp(\u2212\u03bbQG||\u03d5||). It has long been understood that these exponential decay coefficients \u03b1, \u03bbQG should be order-one numbers in Planck units,1 but recently these values have been pinned down with greater precision. Reference [2] presented strong evidence that the coefficient \u03b1 of the lightest tower in a given infinite-distance limit must satisfy \u221a 1 d\u22122 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 qd\u22121 d\u22122 in d spacetime dimensions, and several subsequent works [3\u20135] argued that the species scale should decay with a coefficient \u221a 1 (d\u22121)(d\u22122) \u2264 \u03bbQG \u2264 \u221a 1 d\u22122 . Finally, [6, 7] provided strong evidence for not merely an inequality, but actually an equality, which relates the two decay coefficients mentioned above. In the case of a 1-dimensional moduli space, this equality takes the form \u03b1\u03bbQG = 1/(d\u22122). More generally, the equality takes the form \u2207\u20d7 m m \u00b7 \u2207\u20d7 \u039bQG \u039bQG = 1 d \u2212 2 , (1) where m is the characteristic mass scale of the lightest tower in the infinite distance limit, the gradient \u2207\u20d7 involves the derivative with respect to every massless modulus of the theory, and the inner product is taken with respect to the metric gij on moduli space, which is parametrized by vacuum expectation values of the massless scalar fields. Plugging in m = m0 exp(\u2212\u03b1\u03d5) and \u039bQG = \u039b0 exp(\u2212\u03bbQG\u03d5), we see that (1) indeed reduces to \u03b1\u03bbQG = 1/(d \u2212 2) for a 1-dimensional moduli space.\r\nIn [6, 7], equation (1)\u2013which the authors referred to as the \u201cpattern\u201d\u2013was conjectured to apply in any infinitedistance limit in the moduli space. Within such limits, the pattern may be viewed as a consequence of the Emergent String Conjecture [8], which leads to tight constraints on the set of exponentially light towers and the relationships between them [9]. The Emergent String Conjecture holds that every infinite-distance limit is either a decompactification limit or an emergent string limit in an appropriate duality frame, which in turn implies that the lightest tower of particles is either a tower of Kaluza-Klein modes or a tower of string oscillation modes. In addition, it suggests that the scale \u039bQG should be (roughly) identified with either a string scale or a higher-dimensional Planck scale, which can be used to justify the pattern (1), as well as many of the other bounds on light towers and the species scale mentioned above [9]. It is not so clear, however, how this whole story carries over to the interior of moduli space, which is the region of greatest practical importance for phenomenology and cosmology. As pointed out in [7], even the notion of the \u201clightest tower\u201d in moduli space is not generically well-defined outside the asymptotic regimes of moduli space. One exception to this, however, comes from towers of BPS particles, which remain well-defined throughout moduli space. Similarly, although the definition of the species scale may be subtle, the tension T of a BPS string is well-defined throughout moduli space, and from it we may define a string scale via Mstring \u2261 \u221a 2\u03c0T. One setting in which both BPS particles and BPS strings appear is supergravity in five dimensions, which offers a rich and diverse landscape of quantum gravity theories arising from M-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In this work, we explore this landscape, demonstrating that a suitably refined version of (1) persists even into the interior of moduli space, where other universal features of infinite-distance limits cease to be valid.\r\n",

Salem Ramaswami Mudaliar was a munsif (junior judge) in the British Raj, and a great connoisseur of Tamil literature. It was a conversation between these two that sparked UVeSa\u2019s quest. \r\nOne day, Judge Ramaswami taunted UVeSa saying, \u2018What do you know of the ancient classics?

    "Prompt": "The Indian way of life inculcates in itself religion and ethics. Religion teaches that people should be wantless and selfless, this is the basic requirement for a happy and satisfied life. Human tendency is to live a life full of luxury. A luxurious life is based on power and money, and it is the most profound want of people's lives. Throughout life people are running behind these two wants i.e., Power and Money. Wants and wishes first would appear in people's imaginations and then surface more abundantly as a cause of misery when they are unable to fulfill them. Furthermore, as soon as a desire is satisfied, a feeling occurs in their mind for repeated satisfaction of the desire, as well as the generation of many other allied units. Thus, the fulfillment of a desire gives rise to a new set of desires, which leads to a new cause of misery if the needs and desires are not met. This never-ending cycle of satisfying one wants to satisfy another continues indefinitely. As a result, satisfying a want does not complete the circle of desire and suffering.\r\nA wantlessness is the state of mind in which there is no chance of arousing pain or getting pleasure. Happiness is the finest word to describe how one feels in such a state of mind. Happiness is more than merely the absence of sorrow, it is a state of being free of pain. When pain is eliminated, happiness is maximized. As a result, happiness is the final goal of human conduct. Pleasure, on the other hand, is merely a means to an end. It is more likely that happiness will be attained when pleasure is maximized. It might be said that someone is in a state of wantlessness when they have reached a degree of fulfillment and feel empty. As a result of ceasing to respond to stimuli as usual, they no longer have any needs or wants, and hence don't require any effort to be satisfied. To begin with, new cravings originate from our worldly needs for so-called luxuries. When these luxuries become a part of our routine, they become necessary for our comfort. It not only becomes a necessity but also a cause of pain. One must overcome flaws and impurities in order to uncover their true self.\r\nOne should not let their desires control them. To achieve this state of wantlessness, one must first govern one's physical existence by comprehending the momentary nature of happiness derived from desires outside one's core demands.\r\nThe concept of materialism implies that one may find satisfaction via the accumulation of commodities, which opposes the existential belief that life itself cannot be found in external things. Wantlessness enables people to let go of their reliance on external sources of happiness. According to the materialist worldview, the only way to be happy is to get all of one's wishes. It opposes the concept of self-love as well as the concept of self-respect and self-guidance by rejecting the concept of self-respect.\r\nWhat this way of life called? Is there any verses in hindu scripture that says this?\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Life is as vibrant and fast-paced as the water in the river. Life moves with the passage of time, and as time passes, we get older. Experiences, situations, ideas, and people all change throughout time. Nothing in life is constant. Anything that is lost once is gone forever. If you are moving with emotion, sadness, desire, and sorrow, it represents the presence of life. Dynamism reflects that if something is over the probability of its repetition is not easy. The characteristics of dynamism exist with the river also. If we observe the life of an individual it changes from one phase to another phase and the previous phase cannot be revisited. A Baby is born in a protected and cared environment and grows toward its adolescent phase. During this period, a youngster began learning little to moderate things that he retained for the rest of his life. He will not need to learn it again, nor will he learn it. As life moves from one phase to another phase life is getting enriched by different experiences. These experiences transform an individual from an immature individual to a mature individual. Once an individual lost its immaturity and became mature, he will never again be an immature person in its entire life. That is why it is stated that once something is gone from life, it is gone forever. An adult transform into an older one and in the end, it ultimately leads to the end of life. Individual is born then he cannot take birth again, He will become an adult once in life. He will be older only once in life and he will die only once. Once you say something to anyone you can apologize but you cannot take back your words. Once you have taken any unethical action you can rectify it in your next action but previous unethical action which you did cannot be rectified or reverted back. Once you have shown your affection and love to someone you cannot show the same second time. Next time the affection and love you show will be the next one not the previous one because the instance or point of that moment passed away. During the study once you crossed one barrier that will not come again for the first time. Whenever it will come again it will be the second or third.\r\n\r\nIndia became a free nation on the 15th of August 1947 and this day is the first Independence Day of India. Every year we celebrate Independence Day but it will never be the first one because the first celebration of independence has passed on date 15th August 1947. Same thing happened with the Republic Day of India which was celebrated on the 26th of January 1950. Life is full of challenges and associated with the several kinds of events which come once in life and are lost forever so considering these aspects, life reveals the secrets that an individual should live in the present and focus on what he is doing at a particular point of moment. Because the future depends on the decision and action taken in the present.\r\n\r\nMake 5 questions from this essay and 1 question should be MCQ.",

The nature of the crisis itself is quite diverse. There are drought conditions in parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka, with no access to water for humans, cattle or agriculture. According to a NITI Aayog report last year, as many as 600 million people in India was faced with high to extreme water crisis and 21 large cities\u2014including Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai\u2014will have no groundwater left by 2020.

    "Prompt": "\u201cThe 13th Amendment was the first amendment to the United States Constitution during the period of Reconstruction. The amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865, and ended the argument about whether slavery was legal in the United States. The amendment reads, \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe 13th Amendment was necessary because the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln in January of 1863, did not end slavery entirely; those ensllaved in border states had not been freed. The proclamation also did not address the issue of slavery in territories that would become states in the future. Lincoln and other leaders realized amending the Constitution was the only way to officially end slavery. The 13th Amendment forever abolished slavery as an institution in all U.S. states and territories.\r\n\r\nIn addition to banning slavery, the amendment outlawed the practice of involuntary servitude and peonage. Involuntary servitude or peonage occurs when a person is coerced to work in order to pay off debts. The 13th Amendment exempts from the involuntary servitude clause persons convicted of a crime, and persons drafted to serve in the military.\r\n\r\nThe 13th Amendment to the Constitution did not end discrimination against those who had been enslaved and blacks.

A professor of philosophy at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, Martin asserts well-researched scholastic findings and thoughtfully referenced writings of suicidal authors to shape his narratives. The most crucial credential, however, is the fact that Clancy Martin is chronically suicidal. He has attempted to kill himself at least 10 times. From the age of 6, he has tried many methods that involved a running bus, a long night swim, a razor in a bathtub, nakedness in a bed of snow, and a dog leash. These attempts are fueled by deep depression and alcohol and drug addictions. He\u2019s been thrown in jail and confined in psychiatric hospitals. The personal accounts of these events are raw and gut-wrenching. His struggles have real consequences. The addictions and suicidal behaviors destroyed his two marriages and strained the relationships with his children. The author makes no glorification of suicide and addiction. Cautions are carefully placed like emergency brakes throughout the book.\r\n\r\nSuicide is perhaps one of the most paradoxical and divisive topics in human history. While suicide is condemned, it is also romanticized in poems and literature. It can be viewed as an act of great courage, and at the same breadth, a cowardly escape. Suicide leaves us confused. Is suicide a final act of control or a loss of control? Is it a selfless or a selfish display? Where do we place the anger of our loved one being murdered, when the murderer and the victim are the same person?\r\n\r\nThe issue is not that there aren\u2019t any answers to these questions. Rather, it is that we don\u2019t ask the questions frequently enough. Despite being ranked constantly in the top ten as a leading cause of death in many countries, suicide remains a topic of taboo and shame. No one wants to talk about it. The stigma worsens the suicide epidemics as the biggest barrier to suicide prevention is silence.\r\n\r\nClancy Martin ends the book with a list of items that have shifted his frame of thought about addiction and suicide. The list is not anything ground-breaking, but it provides an uplifting testimony from a man who has tried his best to move forward despite the setbacks that could have been life-ending",

    "Prompt": "In recent years, the landscape of the traditional workplace has undergone a profound transformation. With advancements in technology and a growing emphasis on employee well-being, organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of flexible work schedules. This shift is not just a response to the demands of the modern workforce; it is a strategic move with far-reaching implications, particularly in the realm of job satisfaction. In this article, we will delve into the multifaceted relationship between flexible work schedules and job satisfaction, exploring the ways in which this innovative approach is reshaping the dynamics of the workplace.\r\nThe Evolution of Work:\r\nThe conventional 9-to-5 work structure, once considered the standard, has given way to more adaptable and personalized schedules. The evolution of work is closely tied to societal changes, technological advancements, and a growing awareness of the importance of work-life balance. Flexible work schedules represent a departure from rigid time constraints, allowing employees to tailor their work hours to better suit their individual needs and preferences.\r\nThe Connection to Job Satisfaction:\r\nAt the heart of the discussion lies the assertion that implementing flexible work schedules directly improves job satisfaction. Job satisfaction, a critical metric in assessing employee well-being, encompasses various factors, including work-life balance, autonomy, and overall contentment with one's professional life. Flexible work schedules, when thoughtfully implemented, have the potential to positively influence these factors and contribute to a more satisfied and engaged workforce.\r\n\r\nFlexible work schedules enable employees to better balance their professional and personal lives. The ability to adjust working hours to accommodate personal commitments, such as family responsibilities or personal pursuits, fosters a sense of control and equilibrium. When individuals can seamlessly integrate work into their lives without compromising personal priorities, it significantly enhances overall job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nGranting employees the autonomy to manage their work schedules empowers them to take ownership of their tasks. This autonomy is a powerful motivator, as individuals feel trusted and responsible for their work. When employees have the flexibility to determine when and where they work, it can lead to a greater sense of empowerment, which in turn contributes to higher levels of job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOne of the tangible benefits of flexible work schedules is the potential reduction in commuting stress. Long commutes have been linked to decreased job satisfaction and increased stress levels. By allowing employees to work remotely or adopt flexible hours, organizations can mitigate the negative impact of commuting on their workforce, leading to a more content and focused group of professionals.\r\n\r\nContrary to traditional concerns about remote work leading to decreased productivity, many studies indicate that flexible work schedules can enhance overall job performance. When employees have the flexibility to work during their most productive hours or in environments conducive to concentration, it can result in heightened efficiency and, consequently, greater job satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe workforce is increasingly diverse, with individuals navigating different life stages and facing distinct challenges. Flexible work schedules acknowledge this diversity by accommodating various needs. Whether it's a parent juggling childcare responsibilities or a night owl who thrives in the late hours, the adaptability of flexible schedules ensures that work aligns with individual preferences, fostering a more inclusive and supportive workplace culture.\r\nImplementation Strategies:\r\nWhile the benefits of flexible work schedules are evident, successful implementation requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Organizations must consider the nature of their work, communication methods, and the establishment of clear expectations. Additionally, fostering a culture that values outcomes over hours is essential in reaping the full rewards of flexible work arrangements.\r\nConclusion:\r\nIn conclusion, the correlation between implementing flexible work schedules and improved job satisfaction is not merely a conjecture; it is a reality shaping the contemporary workplace. As organizations continue to prioritize the well-being of their employees, the adoption of flexible work schedules stands out as a progressive and effective strategy. By recognizing the diverse needs of their workforce and providing the autonomy to manage work in a way that suits individual lifestyles, organizations can not only enhance job satisfaction but also unlock unprecedented levels of creativity, productivity, and loyalty among their employees. In the era of flexible work, the path to a more satisfied and engaged workforce begins with the willingness to embrace change and adapt to the evolving dynamics of the modern workplace.\r\nCheck if the given text logically proves the statement that \"implementing flexible work schedules directly improves job satisfaction.\" Mention all the benefits the text provided in short bullet points\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Buddha was probably right when he observed that desire is the root of misery. It's not hard to understand how it relates to a consumerism-driven way of life. Never being satisfied by what you have will just make you crave more. There should be a clear mindset that materialism does not make you happy in the long term. Materialism is only able to provide you happiness in the short term and temporarily. Once materialism is seen for what it is, materialism loses its appeal. A conscious knowledge about materialism will only be possible through the exploration of one's inner self. There is a need to explore knowledge through introspection and being directed towards the inner self. We have a wide range of desires, but we are constrained in our ability to fulfill our desires. If we have too many goals in our life then it will lead to distraction and we will not be able to focus anywhere. If we have too many things to do then our energy will drain out and nothing will be achieved. The problem is not a lack of desire, but rather that we urge too much. The problem is that we desire too much rather than not enough. Although we lack funds, we wish to make money. Although we want to marry, we haven't found the appropriate individual. We don't have the funds to support our desire to attend college. Despite not knowing how, we want to be happy.\r\nFind out if the given text logically entails the assertion: \u201cdesire is the root of misery\u201d.\r\n",

In 1993, Diana reportedly confronted a photographer who was waiting for her outside of a movie theatre in London, yelling, \u201cYou make my life hell!\u201d\r\nBut Diana also recognized the power of the press as a tool to transform public opinion. She had photographers on standby when she shook hands with AIDS patients in 1987 amid homophobic myths that the virus spread through casual touch. A decade later, Diana walked through a minefield in Angola to raise awareness of efforts to clear landmines around the world. \u201cWhen she realized some photographers didn\u2019t get the shot, she turned around and did it again,\u201d the Associated Press recounted in 2022. \r\nDiana\u2019s oft-contentious, sometimes symbiotic dynamic with Britain\u2019s tabloids reached its peak on August 31, 1997, when an early morning car chase with photographers eager to capture footage of her and her new beau, Dodi al-Fayed, took a fatal turn. The British public awoke to the news that the 36-year-old royal was dead, killed in a crash that also claimed the lives of Dodi and the couple\u2019s driver. Prime Minister Tony Blair eulogized Diana as \u201cthe people\u2019s princess,\u201d and the outpouring of grief that followed underscored the accuracy of his assessment.\r\nDiana \u201chad such a compressed life,\u201d says Arianne Chernock, a historian at Boston University. \u201cThe fact that she died in her 30s, with so much possibility, is part of her enduring mystique, \u2026 but it\u2019s also that she wore so many different hats in that short life, and that we really saw this woman coming into her own in full public view.\u201d\r\n\r\nTake out the incidents and arrange them chronically from year 1993 to 2022 . Rephrase in a casual, tabloid-type tone.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Summary of subgroups of SO(d + 1, 1) and Unitarity The group SO(d + 1, 1) is composed of the following subgroups: rotations M = SO(d), dilatations A = SO(1, 1), special conformal transformations N, maximally compact subgroup K = SO(d + 1) and spatial translations N\u02dc . What sets de Sitter in d + 1 dimensions apart from Minkowski in d + 1 dimensions is that this list does not involve time translations which exist for the Poincar\u00b4e group, ISO(d, 1), instead it has dilatations and special conformal transformations. The lack of time translations is also what sets de Sitter apart from Anti de Sitter, whose isometry group in d + 1 dimensions is SO(d, 2). In general, unitary irreducible representations are induced by the invariant subgroup. For the group SO(d+1, 1) there are two sets of invariant subgroups. One of them is made up of dilatations, special conformal transformations and rotations (NAM). This invariant subgroup induces the principal and complementary series representations. The second invariant subgroup is the maximally compact subgroup K, and this is the one that induces discrete series representations. Being induced by a compact group also hints the possibility to talk about highest and lowest weight states. The exceptional series are in general reducible into discrete series [1] and in two and four dimensions they overlap with discrete series [3]. The representation theory of the de Sitter group has been well studied in Mathematics literature, dating back to the works of Harisch-Chandra [10]. There are two main ways to construct representations, either from the action of finite group elements [1], or from the algebra [9, 11]. Recent reviews of both methods catered towards a CFT construction can be found in [12] and of the first method catered towards cosmological applications in [5]. In global coordinates, as well as static patch coordinates, the metric of dSd+1 can be analytically continued into the sphere metric S d+2. Similarly, the group SO(d + 1, 1) can be analytically continued to the group SO(d + 2). One can make use of this analytic continuation to capture the representations as well, where some of the generators are effected by the analytical continuation. This method has been employed to study scalars [13] a well as fermions [14] on de Sitter, and it works differently in d + 1 = 2 dimensions [11, 15], then it does in higher dimensions. The unitary irreducible representations are labeled by the eigenvalues of the quadratic Casimir which involve spin s, which is in general also the eigenvalue of the rotation subgroup except for some of the exceptional series categories and the scaling weight c. We will denote these labels as \u03c7 = {s, c}. Among these two labels, the scaling weight plays a special role as it determines the categorization of the representations. The scaling weight is a part of the scaling dimension that carries information about the mass of the field. Under dilatations an operator with scaling dimensions \u2206 transforms as follows as ~x \u2192 \u03bb~x, O(\u03bb~x) = \u03bb \u2212\u2206O(~x), where ~x \u2208 Rd . For the group SO(d + 1, 1) the scaling dimension has a very fixed format based on the number of spatial dimensions d and the scaling weight c as follows \u2206 = d 2 + c.\r\nFor SO(d+1, 1) both real and purely imaginary c give rise to unitary representations. However the range of c determines the category of the representation. For comparison complex scaling dimensions of SO(d, 2) do not capture unitary representations. This difference between dS and AdS is due to the lack and presence of time translations in each one.\r\n\r\nexplain whats SO(d+1) and (d+1,1) along with formulation of this equation - ~x \u2192 \u03bb~x, O(\u03bb~x) = \u03bb \u2212\u2206O(~x)\r\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school\" invites us to explore the profound distinction between the act of learning within the classroom and the enduring essence of education. While formal schooling equips us with knowledge and skills, true education transcends the boundaries of curriculum and textbooks. It encompasses a lifelong journey of personal growth, self-discovery, and the application of wisdom acquired from various sources. \r\nSchools and educational institutions serve as essential foundations for acquiring knowledge, skills, and socialization. They offer structured environments where individuals are exposed to a wide range of subjects, fostering intellectual growth and critical thinking. The formal education system is designed to impart a standardized body of knowledge, laying the groundwork for students to navigate the complexities of the world.\r\nIn school, we learn mathematics, science, literature, history, and a myriad of other subjects that provide us with a solid academic foundation. We are introduced to teachers and mentors who guide us, imparting knowledge, and nurturing our intellectual development. Furthermore, the classroom environment fosters interpersonal skills, teamwork, and cooperation, all of which are essential in the real world.\r\nKnowledge acquired in school is not an end in itself but rather a means to an end. Over time, the specific facts, equations, dates, and details we learn in school may fade from our memory. What endures, though, is the capacity to think critically, solve problems, and adapt to new challenges. This enduring aspect of education transcends the confines of formal education.\r\nConsider, for instance, a student who learns a complex mathematical theorem in school. Years later, they might not remember the exact formula or method, but they retain the ability to approach mathematical problems with a logical mindset. The essence of their mathematical education remains, despite the fading of specific knowledge.\r\nTrue education extends beyond the classroom and continues throughout one's life. It is a commitment to lifelong learning and self-improvement. In a rapidly changing world, the ability to adapt and learn continuously is a valuable asset. The skills acquired through formal education provide a foundation upon which individuals can build throughout their lives.\r\nFaraday, born into poverty without formal education, gained scientific knowledge while working as a bookbinder. He read up on a lot of science and took initiative, independently discovering electromagnetism, inventing the Bunsen burner, finding benzene, and creating the first electric motor and generator. His self-driven pursuits led him to become one of the most significant scientists in history.\r\nAct as Socrates and rewrite this text in the same manner his teachings are written.

    "Prompt": "Investing in education is one of the most powerful ways to create a just society with reduced reliance on charity. When education is accessible and of high quality, individuals have the skills and knowledge needed to secure meaningful employment and contribute positively to society. This not only reduces poverty but also decreases the need for charitable assistance.\r\nJustice and charity are intertwined aspects of a well-functioning society. While charity is essential for providing immediate relief to those facing crises and vulnerabilities, justice serves as the foundation for long-term equity and fairness. A society that prioritizes justice can substantially reduce the need for charity by ensuring that all its members have equal opportunities, access to essential services, and a social safety net that supports them during challenging times. \r\nWhile it may not be feasible to entirely eliminate the need for charity, the goal should be to minimize its necessity by addressing systemic injustices and creating a society where individuals can thrive independently. By investing in education, economic justice, and strong social safety nets, we can move closer to a future where charity is less about addressing systemic failures and more about providing a helping hand to those who face exceptional circumstances. In such a society, justice and charity can work in harmony to create a more compassionate and equitable world for all. \r\n\r\nAsses the logical connection between \u2013 \u201ccharity is essential for providing immediate relief\u201d and \u201cimmediate relief can only be delivered by Justice\u201d\r\n",

    "Prompt": "In recent years, a rich dialogue has developed between quantum information theory and high energy physics, especially in the context of gauge-gravity dualities. To make this connection precise, we must define quantum information in relativistic continuum theories: this is tricky business because it requires defining physics in a subregion. In the Von Neumman algebra language, the operator algebra for a subregion is type III, which has no trace or pure states: this is due to universal divergences associated to entanglement of UV modes near the subregion boundary, leading to infinite amount of entanglement that makes entanglement entropy ill defined. In place of the algebraic approach, one could follow the usual paradigm of QFT and introduces a regulator that separates a subregion V from its complement V\u00af 1 . This regulates the the universal divergences and renders the algebra type 1, allowing a factorization of the Hilbert space and a definition of a reduced density matrix, from which entanglement entropies can be computed. However, in gauge theories and gravity, the naive factorization fails again due to gauge constraints that cross the entangling surface. A standard resolution of this problem is given by the extended Hilbert space construction [4, 5]. One relaxes the gauge constraints linking degrees of freedom across the entangling surface. The lifting of these constraints introduces edge degrees of freedom in the subregion Hilbert spaces, ; we refer to these as entanglement edge modes. The factorization of the gauge theory Hilbert space can then be achieved via an embedding i : Hphysical \u2192 HV \u2297 HV\u00af (1.1) into an extended Hilbert space.\r\nThe embedding (1.1) leads to a well defined reduced density matrix \u03c1V on HV from which one can compute quantum information quantities such as entanglement entropy. The entanglement edge modes give an important contribution to the EE [6, 7] . In particular, they have been conjectured to give a bulk accounting of gravitational entropy in quantum gravity. A concrete realization of this conjecture was given recently in pure AdS3 gravity [8, 9], where the gravitational entropy (given by the quantum extremal surface formula) was identified with entanglement entropy of bulk gravity edge modes.\r\n\r\nI want this into French but the formulas should be in Markdown format.

It can\u2019t be. He was always gentle. If you\u2019d have seen him playing with the children, anybody who saw him with the children would have known that there wasn\u2019t any bad in him, not one mean bone. When I first met him he was still living with his mother, over near Spring Lake, and I used to see them together, the mother and the sons, and think that any young fellow that was that nice with his family must be one worth knowing. Then one time when I was walking in the woods I met him by himself coming back from a hunting trip. He hadn\u2019t got any game at all, not so much as a field mouse, but he wasn\u2019t cast down about it. He was just larking along enjoying the morning air. \r\nThat\u2019s one of the things I first loved about him. He didn\u2019t take things hard, he didn\u2019t grouch and whine when things didn\u2019t go his way. So we got to talk that day. And I guess things moved right along after that, because pretty soon he was over here pretty near all the time. And my sister said \u2014 see, my parents had moved out the year before and gone south, leaving us the place \u2014 my sister said, kind of teasing but serious, \u201cWell! If he\u2019s going to be here every day and half the night, I guess there isn\u2019t room for me!\u201d And she moved out \u2014 just down the way. We\u2019ve always been real close, her and me.

And all I can say is, it was the happiest year of my life. He was just purely good to me. A hard worker and never lazy, and so big and fine-looking. Everybody looked up to him, you know, young as he was. Lodge Meeting nights, more and more often they had him to lead the singing. He had such a beautiful voice, and he\u2019d lead off strong, and the others following and joining in, high voices and low. It brings the shivers on me now to think of it, hearing it, nights when I\u2019d stayed home from meeting when the children was babies \u2014 the singing coming up through the trees there, and the moonlight, summer nights, the full moon shining. I\u2019ll never hear anything so beautiful. I\u2019ll never know a joy like that again.\r\n\r\nHow does the narrator's view of the person that she talks about changes throughout the passage?

    "Prompt": "Simplicity extends beyond aesthetics and intellectual pursuits; it is deeply intertwined with human character and values. In an era where material possessions and societal status often define success, a person who embraces simplicity stands out as a beacon of authenticity and self-awareness. Mahatma Gandhi's minimalist lifestyle, driven by his commitment to truth and non-materialism, exemplifies how simplicity can become a powerful statement of one's principles. It reflects a conscious choice to rise above the superficial and prioritize what truly matters be it personal relationships, ethical values, or the pursuit of knowledge. \r\nIn an age of environmental challenges, simplicity takes on a new dimension as a sustainable way of life. The consumerist culture of excess has led to overconsumption, depletion of resources, and environmental degradation. Embracing simplicity in our consumption patterns, choosing quality over quantity, favoring durable goods over disposables contributes not only to personal well-being but also to the larger goal of preserving the planet for future generations. The concept of minimalism, which encourages mindful consumption and reduction of waste, aligns seamlessly with the principles of sustainability. \r\nSimplicity can serve as a catalyst for boundless creativity. When the mind is unburdened by unnecessary complexities, it gains the freedom to explore, innovate, and create. \r\nEffective communication is often rooted in simplicity. Whether conveying complex scientific concepts to a broad audience or crafting a persuasive argument, the ability to distill information into clear and concise messages is a skill of profound sophistication. Think of the eloquence of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech; its power lies in its simplicity, enabling it to resonate across generations and inspire social change. \r\nCultivating simplicity requires a conscious and deliberate effort, particularly in a world that bombards us with distractions and excesses. Mindfulness practices, such as meditation and minimalism, offer pathways to embracing simplicity in our lives. By decluttering our physical spaces, streamlining our routines, and nurturing meaningful connections, we can create an environment conducive to clarity of thought and a deeper appreciation for the beauty in simplicity. \r\nIn this complex world, the idea that \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\" stands out as a timeless and universal principle. It means that keeping things simple is really smart, even though it might seem basic. When we understand and embrace simplicity, it brings a lot of good things. It makes things more beautiful and easier to understand. It also helps us be better people, take better care of the Earth, and be more creative. This simple approach to life has a big and positive impact. \r\nI want you to Verify the authenticity of the claim that \u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication\u201d from above.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Chern\u2013Simons (CS) theory with a complex gauge group has been an excellent laboratory for studying various aspects of quantum field theory (QFT) since it is essentially exactly solvable. In recent years, building on previous work by physicists and mathematicians, perturbative and non-perturbative methods have been introduced, making it possible to calculate various observables, and many beautiful and interesting results have been obtained. For example, for the complements of hyperbolic knots in the three-sphere, the wave function of the theory with gauge group SL(2, C) has been defined rigorously [1], inspired in part by physics developments [2, 3]. This wave function satisfies, in addition, a difference equation, which can be determined by an appropriate quantization of the classical A-polynomial of the knot [4], as expected from physics arguments [5]. \r\nIn this paper, we will further study the wave functions for complements of hyperbolic knots in CS theory with gauge group SL(2, C). As we will show, they share many structural similarities with the wave functions occurring in topological string theory and, more precisely, in the context of the so-called topological string/spectral theory (TS/ST) correspondence [6\u20139] and its open string version [10\u201313]. Indeed, it has been found in both cases that the WKB expansion in \u210f of the perturbative wave function of the topological string can be resummed into a q-series1 , where q = ei\u210f . However, this q-series displays singularities at all points of the form \u210f \u2208 2\u03c0Q . (1.1) Since these singularities are not present in the non-perturbative definition of the wave function, they are an artifact of the resummed WKB expansion. This feature, in turn, requires the presence of a non-perturbative sector that cancels the singularities and leads to a finite answer for the full wave function. The cancellation of singularities at the values of \u210f in Eq. (1.1) is a defining attribute of Faddeev\u2019s quantum dilogarithm [14], which can be regarded as a simple example of a wave function in complex CS theory. A similar cancellation mechanism has appeared in a more complicated context in ABJM theory, where it is sometimes referred to as the HMO mechanism [15], and is one of the facets of the non-perturbative proposal for topological string theory put forward in [6\u20138]. Moreover, the concrete realization of the cancellation of singularities in topological string theory is a consequence of the integrality structure of the topological string amplitudes. In the closed string case, one has the Gopakumar\u2013Vafa integrality [16] and its refinement [17]. In the open string case, as shown in [10, 12, 18], one needs an integrality property akin to the one found in [19\u201321]. In this paper, we conjecture a similar integrality structure for the resummed WKB expansion of the wave functions of complex CS theory and support our claims with explicit evidence obtained in examples. This integrality structure, indeed, guarantees the cancellation of singularities. A similar integrality property has been found in [22], and it would be interesting to clarify its relationship with our results. Our integrality conjecture characterizes the so-called holomorphic blocks of the wave functions [23], and the corresponding integer invariants can be calculated from these blocks when they are explicitly known. Analogously to the case of topological string theory, at the special values of \u210f in Eq. (1.1), which we refer to as rational points, the generic formula for the exact wave function has an apparent singularity. However, after the cancellation mechanism takes place, one typically finds a relatively simpler expression. It is an interesting task to determine this expression for general rational numbers, as it was done for Faddeev\u2019s quantum dilogarithm in [24]. In this paper, we develop various independent techniques to achieve this goal, following ideas proposed in the context of the open TS/ST correspondence [12, 25, 26]. To begin with, one can use the underlying integrality structure to derive an explicit answer at rational values of \u210f in terms of the newly introduced integer invariants. Second, one can start directly from the AJ equation for the wave function and specialize it to rational values, where one finds a quasi-periodic structure similar to the one appearing in spectral problems on lattices. Finally, one can directly evaluate the Andersen\u2013Kashaev state integral at rational points using the techniques of [24]. We apply these three distinct methods and explicitly show that they lead to the same results in various examples.\r\nWhat\u2019s Gopakumar\u2013Vafa integrality in this passage and WKB expansion of the wave functions?\r\n",

These words first emanated from the French philosopher; Jean Jacques Rousseau but later with the onset of more technological innovations, many joined the chorus of \u2018technology has ruined us.\u2019 The most devastating revelation has come from the mouth of the Israeli philosopher; Yuval Noah Harari who in his book \u2018lessons for 21st century,\u2019 said some 10 years later; corporations would know better what an individual wants. The problematic is not only of human wants and aspirations rather it is; what humanity is all about; what a person is born for, what is his mission in life. Many have said; even earlier it was not under his control, religion, the Goliath, has aways decided why a person is born, what is his duty in this life and what one is destined to. The critics say, there were lots of space for the heretics to go astray; establish heretic foundations, even they have formed the sects.

The developments which have not created a revolution; if at all one means by revolution; a radical redistribution of power, privilege and prestige. No, it has not happened, rather the contrary has happened. Power is now concentrated in few hands; resources are concentrated even in more fewer hands. Prestige is something subjective. It cannot be objectified. One cannot force people to respect him or her. There are attempts to control even prestige. The question is after all what has changed. It is technology, that has changed. Name an area, where the technology has not changed but even there; the more qualitative changes are in the field of information. Now; really the world has become a global village.

The psychologists, the world over have tried to uncover the drives and motivations which go beyond or beneath the apparent. The most interesting thing, Karl Jung said in one\u2019s relations and reactions to others, the individual is telling more about oneself than the other. USA have seen tremendous development in the field of individual or the mind of the individual. The individual matters in entrepreneurship; he has to be agile, innovative, inspiring, intelligent and calculating. That great country of business and industry; USA has been the capital of market economy. The important thing is when the board wants to know about a person, they ask him/her to describe, someone else and the board understands what he or she is capable of. \r\nOne group of post graduate students were discussing this very phenomenon. The discussion soon turned out to be a running match between those who said \u2018yes\u2019 when a person is describing the other, is basically describing him/herself and the others said, no, when one is describing the other, he is basically describing the other. Group A: You see, Sigmund Freud said, when a person is talking about others, he is doing that according to his/her perception but more important is the person is seeing himself in others. He imagines, the other person must not violate rules, he has limits on the capacity of adventure, he is intelligent but not laborious, he cannot take dangerous risks and if the company demands to pursue more innovative ways to increase sales, he will not do it. Group B: No, everybody realizes the other party is different from him. Freud also said, there is always an \u2018I\u2019 which is the indication of one\u2019s motives, aspirations, desires, wishes and unique dispositions. \u2018Me\u2019 is the significant others or those with whom a person is close but at the same time those he emulates. The others or the society at large is the super ego. He or Freud said in his or her evaluation of the other; all these things matter. Those who say it is just a reflection of one\u2019s own desires, simply is ignoring the role of super ego. In one sense, if \u2018ID\u2019 is the peculiar self of the individual, can one person deny the role of his individual drives and idiosyncracies or individuality.\r\n\r\nIdk what the writer meant in that group of post graduate example, who said yes others said no.

It is important to know how to differentiate between a dead tree and one that is just shedding its leaves due to seasonal changes.\r\n\r\nAlso, leaf loss happens differently on different tree species, making it hard to know which trees are dying and which ones are not.\r\n\r\nSometimes a loss of leaves is an indicator of a problem. A tree unnaturally losing its leaves can be caused by aging, excess water problems, starvation, insects and diseases, or a catastrophic event.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the symptoms of a dying tree are easy to identify, but only when you know what to look for.\r\n\r\nUsing the leaves is the easiest way to identify whether the tree is dying or not.\r\n\r\nDeciduous trees are different from evergreen ones, and even if looking at leaves to identify a dying tree is straightforward, you need a little expertise on the type of tree.\r\n\r\nDeciduous trees shed their leaves at the end of the growing season (usually in fall), while evergreen ones remain green all year.1 The shedding of leaves is to prepare for the cold winter season, where the tree seals in the water to preserve itself throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nDue to such characteristics, it might not be easy to tell whether a plant is losing its leaves as part of its growth process or for other reasons.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a tree\u2019s leaves start drying or reducing in number before the end of its growing season, then that is an indicator of a potential problem. Trees that shed off their leaves at the end of their growing season naturally will have a self-healing process that seals the parts where the leaves were to keep the tree safe.\r\n\r\nYou can also check for weak branches or rotted areas on the tree.\r\n\r\nTo identify issues with an evergreen tree, typically these will show brown needles or branches drying out at the top.\r\n\r\ndoes this clai=m that trees die when there are no leaves",

He planned to create his own new religion. He had the skulls of enemy soldiers embedded on his fort walls. He had a whole colony of immigrants executed because some residents plotted a coup. \r\nHe beheaded petty criminals and publicly displayed their heads at Chor Minar\u2026 Stories of bizarre behaviour abound: some apocryphal, many factual. Indeed, Alauddin had a mad streak, but there was method in his madness. He was ruthless, but not reckless. And that was how he vanquished the Mongols.\r\nTwo Asian empires were born in 1206: the Delhi Sultanate and Genghis Khan\u2019s Mongol Empire. The Delhi Sultanate gradually expanded to cover large parts of north India. The Mongol Empire grew rapidly to encompass nearly 25 million sq.km from Korea to Romania. Powerful kingdoms had only two options when the dreaded Mongolians advanced: hand over everything of value, or face complete destruction. Yet, one question puzzles historians: why could the Mongols never conquer Delhi, despite the city being within striking distance? \r\nEarly Mongol expeditions went westward, not southward. Many hypothetical explanations have been offered for this: the Himalayas were a barrier, Mongolian horses were unsuited to Indian terrain, there were too many Indian kings to fight, and so on. Actually, the Mongols did engage in the Indo-Mongol border in the south during the early stages of their empire. There were a few skirmishes, and some ransom extorted from weak Indian kings, but no major wars. The only exception was their capture of Kashmir around 1235. The Mongol focus shifted around the time the Khilji dynasty came to power in Delhi.\r\n\r\nRewrite the text to portray Alauddin Khilji in a postive light.",

In this test; ink blots are provided to individuals selected for the test. We can represent the ink blots to other individuals. These blots are life less symbols, different persons call them different things. The reactions of respondents represent their own self. This test is used to test the personality traits of a person. In the same way; when some one of us, is giving his opinion about others, he is in fact describing him/herself. The group further added the name of George Herbert Mead, the famous Chicago philosopher and psychologist. Mead has been famous for his concept of the Significant Other. Mead said whenever a person meets another person; both of them evaluate each other. The more important thing is, they cognize and react with each other. The same persons when they report to other persons about their meeting, they in fact talk about their own self and not the other. In the same manner if somebody advises somebody else, the frame is the person who is advising and not the other person. \r\nBinary Group: The point you are presenting; seems to be appropriate but don\u2019t you think, it is a question of perception.

We do think there is some truth in the formulation, every perception of the other is really a self -perception but one has to remember, there can be aberrations. Erving Goffman has been recognised as one of the eminent interactionist scholars. Then both the groups seem to agree on the point the reactions of each other are basically self- reactions. True; when one is seeing the other, he sees him through his eyes. This influences the perceptions. Though perception is subjective, there has to be some amount of objectivity in that perception. On one thing both the groups agreed in any perception of others, the perception is a reflection of the person. Raidas, the poet of the medieval age; wrote it is up to you to decide what a thing is, if your moods are up, you will see the Ganga in a big bowl. \r\nSo, a compromise was reached between the two groups; hey agreed, perceptions are not only subjective but they are always coloured by the person concerned. So, both the groups agreed in perception of each other or even in other objects perception, the self is heavily imprinted. The perception changes according to the condition of the parties concerned. The first group still held; it is entirely the person concerned whose self is expressed but the other group viewed some Objectivity is inherent.\r\nExplain to me the meaning of this phrase \u2013 \u2018Everybody is playing a role, it is all drama, the front is not real\u2019. Is this have any confluence with the sentence \u2013 \u2018if somebody advises somebody else, the frame is the person who is advising and not the other person.\u2019 Which group aligns more with the idea of perception, self-expression in the context?\r\n",

This happened during the period of political hostility between the Soviet Union and the United States known as the Cold War. For several years, the two superpowers had been competing to develop missiles, called intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), to carry nuclear weapons between continents. In the U.S.S.R., the rocket designer Sergei Korolev had developed the first ICBM, a rocket called the R7, which would begin the space race.\r\nThis competition came to a head with the launch of Sputnik. Carried atop an R7 rocket, the Sputnik satellite was able to send out beeps from a radio transmitter. After reaching space, Sputnik orbited Earth once every 96 minutes. The radio beeps could be detected on the ground as the satellite passed overhead, so people all around the world knew that it was really in orbit. Realizing that the U.S.S.R. had capabilities that exceeded U.S. technologies that could endanger Americans, the United States grew worried. Then, a month later, on November 3, 1957, the Soviets achieved an even more impressive space venture. This was SputnikII, a satellite that carried a living creature, a dog named Laika.",

    "Prompt": "Summarize this passage, convert the font to bold and make 10 multiple choice questions from it.\r\n\r\nA chimpanzee is one of the great apes and the nearest in intelligence to man. Scientists have examined its mental capacities and sent it into space in anticipation of man. Chimpanzees need little description. Being apes and not monkeys, they have no tails. Their arms are longer than their legs and they normally rim on all fours. They can also walk upright with toes turned outwards. When erect they stand 3-5 ft high. The hair is long and coarse, black except for a white patch near the rump. The face, ears, hands and feet are bare and except for the black face, the flesh is coloured.\r\n\r\nChimpanzees exhibit great concern for each other. When chimpanzees meet after having been apart they greet each other in a very human way by touching each other or even clasping hands. Chimpanzees have amazing social discipline. When a dominant male arrives, the rest of the chimpanzees hurry to pay respect to it. The dominant male is not allowed to wrest food from his inferiors. The members of a party also spend considerable amount of time grooming each other and themselves. Mothers go through the fur of their babies for any foreign particles, dirt, and ticks and they aid each other when they are injured.\r\n\r\nChimpanzees are the best tools users apart from man. Sticks 2-3 ft long are picked off the ground orbaalnfnjai branches and pushed into nests, then withdrawn and the honey or insects licked off. Stones are and ttecacfc nuts or as missiles to drive humans and baboons away from its food. Chimpanzees are not only toolunBUthut also toolmakers. They make their own rods by stripping the leaves off a twig or tear shreds off a chimpanzees learn all this by observing the older chimpanzees making and using them. So man is not the easily toolmaker, merely better at it than his relatives.",

    "Prompt": "1. Tarakeswar Case (1874)\r\nThe popularity of the case is understandable from the fact that authorities had to sell tickets at the entry. The case revolves around Nobin Chandra and his wife Elokeshi. Nobin slit his wife\u2019s throat for allegedly having an affair with the chief priest of Tarakeshwar Temple. Nobin confessed his crime to the police, but the locals were mostly on his side. Due to this, Nobin was released after two years while serving life imprisonment. However, the priest was put behind the bars for three years. In fact, there were rumours doing rounds that the priest had raped Elokeshi by promising to help her with \u201cfertility issues\u201d. This case was even more important due to the \u2018British Raj\u2019 prevalent during that time.\r\n2. Bhawal Case (1921-1946)\r\nOne of the most peculiar identity cases of that time, it revolves around a possible pretender who affirmed to be the prince of Bhawal Estate, largest zamindari estate of Bengal.\r\nRamendra, a kumar of Bhawal estate died in early 1900, but there was tittle-tattle among people that he was not really dead. In 1921, a religious man who looked like Ramendra was spotted in Dhaka. The former tenants and farmers of Ramendra supported his claim to the title. The entire village trusted him except Ramendra\u2019s widow, Bibhabati. After a long legal procedure of 25 years, the court ruled in his favor after which he passed away due to a stroke.\r\nThe interesting thing is that during the case, the look-alike (or whatever) also moved to Calcutta and even collected 1/3rd of the estate revenue.\r\n3. Kiranjit Ahluwalia\u2019s Case\r\nKiranjit Ahluwalia\u2019s case came a year after marital rape was declared as \u2018rape\u2019 in 1991. She was convicted of murder by burning her husband alive during his sleep. The lady in question had been a victim of domestic violence for over a decade and had been in severe depression when she took the step. The case set a benchmark for improving public awareness on domestic abuse. As a final verdict, she was convicted to life imprisonment. However, she was later freed as her conviction of murder was reduced to manslaughter.\r\n5. Mathura Rape Case (1972)\r\nOne of the most prominent cases in the history of India, mainly due to the protests following the final verdict which saw a major overhaul in the rape laws of the country. In the city of Mathura, a tribal woman was raped by two constables within the premises of a police station. During the trial, the judge found the accused not guilty. Can you guess the reason given behind this unfair judgement? As per the judge, a sexual act within the premises of a police station was permitted and consensual. However, this law had to be amended due to the massive protests all over the country, with everyone saying- Submission does not mean consent.\r\nThese were some of the cases which are extremely interesting if you go through the entire judgement. Some cases would have surely made you go \u201cLike what! Are you serious this ever happened?\u201d This proves one thing- The lives of lawyers and judges aren\u2019t as easy as it seems and you must be prepared before taking up the L.L.B. course. They may seem right to some and wrong to others. However, as history has it, wherever they have been wrong, they have acknowledged their mistakes, and the judgement has been changed as well. So, let them do their work while we do ours.\r\n\r\nFrom the above law case studies make questions for the Judicial Service Exams.

With that warning\r\nin mind, such stories can still be valuably illustrative and highlight some of the\r\nunique circumstances that refugees face. Before discussing the refugee experience\r\nin general terms, we briefly describe five individual refugee journeys, each anony-\r\nmized but adapted from a documented story: Example A: A student and waitress lived with her husband and children in a ref-\r\nugee camp near Damascus for several years after their home was destroyed in\r\nthe Syrian civil war. As fighting between opposing forces neared, they paid to\r\nbe trafficked by bus to the Turkish border, a dangerous journey that involved\r\npassing through areas under the control of several rival groups. After a short\r\nperiod staying in a camp in Turkey, they risked a perilously overcrowded boat\r\njourney to Greece and from there proceeded mostly on foot across the Balkans,\r\noften hopping between camps on the way. After being trafficked across the\r\nHungarian border, they were able to take a train to Munich and finally claim\r\nasylum there. Their journey lasted about a month.\r\nExample B: A Rohingya family and their business were persecuted by the army\r\nin a village in Myanmar. After their home was confiscated, they fled their village\r\nand tried to establish a life elsewhere in Myanmar. Their son moved to study in Yangon where he distributed political pamphlets, for which he was arrested and\r\ntortured but secured release through bribery. Fearing further recrimination,\r\nhe fled to Thailand and on to Malaysia where he spent nine years working as\r\nan unauthorized immigrant before being recognized by the United Nations as\r\na refugee. He took a boat journey from Indonesia to Australia, which resulted\r\nin him being held for 32 months in an immigration detention center. A decade\r\nlater he works in construction and for community organizations in Melbourne,\r\nbut still awaits permanent protection status, and has little contact with his family.\r\nExample C: A child was born in a refugee camp of some 200,000 people in Kenya,\r\nto which her parents had fled from the civil war in Somalia. She lived there\r\nfor her first eight years with her parents, siblings, and father\u2019s other wives. She\r\nreceived little education and facilities in the camp were rudimentary. Her fam-\r\nily was eventually selected for resettlement and moved to Baltimore where they\r\nremained for seven years, before relocating to Buffalo to be closer to relatives\r\nand a larger Somali community. She is now studying for a PhD in education.\r\nExample D: A mother of seven in a small community in Honduras participated\r\nin protests when water supplies to her village were compromised by a dam con-\r\nstruction project. She was arrested and charged with trespassing, but the case\r\nwas eventually dismissed. When a fellow protester was shot dead by police, she\r\ndecided to leave with her two-year-old son and joined a migrant caravan travel-\r\ning through Guatemala and Mexico to the US border, including a terrifying\r\njourney on top of a freight train. After crossing the border at Tijuana, she was\r\nheld in detention for two weeks and spent a month in a shelter before relocation\r\nto Portland, Oregon, where she awaits a decision on her asylum application.\r\nExample E: A young gay man moved to the United Kingdom from Algeria\r\nwhen his family discovered he was gay and tried to force him to marry his\r\ncousin. Struggling with depression, he stayed for several years with another\r\ncousin, overstaying his visa and helping with domestic chores while avoiding\r\nthe formal economy. After learning from a charity that he might be eligible\r\nfor refugee status, he applied for and was granted asylum. He now works as a\r\nsous-chef.\r\n\r\nAre there any human right violations in these texts. Violations as per UN charter post WW2.

    "Prompt": "Read this and tell me the meaning of the line \"weakness that can destroy an individual\" in 100 words.\r\n\r\nDealing with the loss of loved ones and grief can be emotionally overwhelming for individuals. Striving for personal development, overcoming self-doubt, and achieving self-acceptance can be a lifelong journey. Meeting academic goals, handling academic pressure, and choosing the right educational path can be challenging for students. Juggling work, family, and personal commitments can be a constant challenge, requiring effective time management.\r\n\r\nAdapting to life's uncertainties, dealing with unexpected changes, and embracing new opportunities can be difficult. Navigating societal expectations, cultural norms, and peer pressure can impact individuals' choices and decisions.\r\n\r\nHowever, like the water that can seep inside a ship and lead to its demise, the presence of weaknesses within an individual may prove to be their downfall. Weaknesses, whether physical, emotional, or psychological, can act as chinks in the armor, making a person susceptible to defeat and despair. It is crucial for individuals to recognize and address their weaknesses, seeking personal growth and self-improvement, for it is only through such efforts that one can hope to overcome the obstacles in life successfully.\r\n\r\nA weakness that can destroy an individual from inside is a lack of self-esteem and self-worth. When someone has low self-esteem, they tend to have a negative perception of themselves and their abilities, leading to a destructive cycle of self-doubt, self-criticism, and negative self-talk. This can have severe consequences on various aspects of their life. Low self-esteem can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. The constant self-criticism and negative thoughts can create a toxic internal environment. People with low self-esteem may struggle to form healthy relationships. They might attract or tolerate abusive or unhealthy relationships because they feel they don't deserve better treatment. Low self-esteem can hinder personal and professional growth. The fear of failure and feelings of inadequacy might prevent them from taking on new challenges or pursuing their goals.\r\n\r\nA lack of self-confidence can lead to indecisiveness and second-guessing. This can make it challenging to trust one's judgment and make sound decisions. Stress and negative emotions resulting from low self-esteem can have a detrimental impact on physical health, contributing to issues like high blood pressure, weakened immune system, and other health problems. Individuals with low self-esteem may neglect self-care and engage in self-destructive behaviors, such as substance abuse, overeating, or avoiding essential medical care.",

For a cubic lattice under an applied hydrostatic pressure P (P < 0 for tension), the stability conditions require the bulk and two shear moduli to be positive, \r\nB D .C11 C 2C12 C P/=3 > 0;\r\nG0 D .C11 C12 2P/=2 > 0;\r\nG D C44 P > 0;\r\nwhere Cij are the elastic constants at the current state. A variety of direct simulation studies [16] have shown that these criteria do accurately describe the critical value of P at which the homogeneous lattice becomes unstable. One may therefore regard such critical values as the ideal or theoretical strength for the particular mode of loading. The extension of stability considerations to the more general behavior of lattice vibrations has been made by the analysis of phonon dispersion curves for deformed lattices, thus allowing for the possibility of onset of soft modes other than longitudinal or transverse acoustic vibrations at k D 0 [11].\r\n",

    "Prompt": "In a world characterized by rapid technological advancements, intricate complexities, and an ever-growing array of options, the concept of simplicity stands out as a timeless beacon of elegance and wisdom. \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,\" encapsulates a profound truth that transcends time and resonates with the essence of human nature. This essay explores the multifaceted significance of simplicity, delving into its manifestations across various aspects of life and its enduring impact on individuals, societies, and even creativity. \r\n\r\nAt first glance, simplicity may appear as a mere absence of complexity, a surface-level reduction of elements. However, true simplicity is an art form that involves distilling the essence of an idea, object, or concept to its purest and most fundamental form. This stripping away of unnecessary embellishments reveals a sense of elegance that is deeply appealing and enduring. \r\n\r\nIronically, embracing simplicity often requires an appreciation for complexity. The capacity to distinguish the crucial elements amidst a complex array showcases a depth of comprehension that stands as a defining trait of sophistication. Take, for instance, the art of storytelling. A well-crafted narrative weaves together a tapestry of characters, plotlines, and emotions, yet the true mastery lies in conveying this complexity to the audience in a coherent and simple manner. \r\n\r\nSimplicity extends beyond aesthetics and intellectual pursuits; it is deeply intertwined with human character and values. In an era where material possessions and societal status often define success, a person who embraces simplicity stands out as a beacon of authenticity and self-awareness. Mahatma Gandhi's minimalist lifestyle, driven by his commitment to truth and non-materialism, exemplifies how simplicity can become a powerful statement of one's principles. It reflects a conscious choice to rise above the superficial and prioritize what truly matters be it personal relationships, ethical values, or the pursuit of knowledge. \r\n\r\nIn an age of environmental challenges, simplicity takes on a new dimension as a sustainable way of life. The consumerist culture of excess has led to overconsumption, depletion of resources, and environmental degradation. Embracing simplicity in our consumption patterns, choosing quality over quantity, favoring durable goods over disposables contributes not only to personal well-being but also to the larger goal of preserving the planet for future generations. The concept of minimalism, which encourages mindful consumption and reduction of waste, aligns seamlessly with the principles of sustainability. \r\n\r\ncreate 8 questions that tests the understanding of the passage and add 2 mcq questions on grammar.",

The Nova Scotia government was going to sell Upper Clements Park (UCP) to a foreign operator. In 1985, MGR undertook a major expansion in anticipation of the potential business to be generated by UCP. In 1989, the year UCP opened, MGR was full of dignitaries attending the opening festivities and tourists flocking to see the new park. Room rentals for the 1989 season reached the highest level in MGR\u2019s history at 11,046 roomnights. Now, four years later, the number of roomnights was the lowest in 17 years and MGR was just breaking even. See Exhibit 1. Even though Beth Earle-Lambert was appointed Managing Director only a few weeks earlier, it was clear to her that MGR finally needed a strategic marketing plan.\r\n\r\nMGR was located in the Evangeline Trail tourism area which covers the western shore of Nova Scotia, from Yarmouth to the Annapolis Valley. See Exhibit 2 for a map of Nova Scotia. The Thornton family had acquired the land in 1915 with the aim of accommodating those who came to the Digby area to fish in the summer. The main building, where the dining room was now located, was built to house the guests. Later, around 1920, a row of cottages was built. These cottages had recently been renovated and modernised, but maintaining a rustic motif.\r\n\r\nThe property changed ownership several times over the next 40 years. In 1969, Gordon Price, a recreation director from Halifax, convinced Peter and Ann Goddard to jointly buy MGR as an investment. The property consisted of approximately 20 acres with the main building, 12 cottages, a swimming pool, a tennis court, and a shuffle board.\r\n\r\nTell me how many times the owners of MGR changed from year 1915 to 1969 , and give the names of each owner?\"",

    "Prompt": "Write an email to my grandson taking lessons from this text and turning them into lessons for life. \r\nIt is a fact, the path of want lessness is not possible for most people. In Jainism those who are laity or are normal house holders; they don\u2019t have the commitment to pursue a life of want lessness; they have the pragmatic way out of leaving the things to those who have sacrificed their family, they are the like the Shramans of Buddhism. Buddha said the life of self-mortification is not normal. This is painful to the practitioner, this will not inspire people to come to this fold, this self- denying life might be apparently attractive but in reality, this may dispel to follow this very religion. On the other hand, Buddha said people are unhappy because there is no end to their desire. Desires must be controlled. Neither the life of desires nor the life of mortification is natural so, a middle path is to be followed. This would be life of right thinking, a life of right action, right view or the positive attitude to look at things, positive lively hood, right effort, right mindfulness, right speech and right action. Not only in precepts but even in practice Buddhism has been a pragmatic approach to life. Buddhism did not make people pacifist as is very often perceived. Ashoka left wars but he never dismantled his army. Buddhism because of its middle path or pragmatism, even the non-deification of its theology could not prevent it from becoming a world religion. Buddhism not only crossed the borders of India but became a world religion, the whole of West Asia, Far East and even South East Asia became Buddhism. In all sides of India; Buddhism was the major religion. So, we socially closed our borders and said crossing the oceans is a great sin. The want lessness is too good to follow; materialism is a blind alley, so, what is the way out Jainism to an extent prescribes want lessness. It is based on self-mortification and self-denial but it remained popular for a long time. Materialism is crass and denies humanism. There are ways to avoid both. The way is Buddhism or to follow the middle path. One need not be in a self-denying mode nor in a mode of get everything. The way out is to follow a humanitarian way. A way where Gandhi can smile with his notion of humanity has everything for its need but not fo its greed.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "The laws of thermodynamics are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of energy and matter in the universe. There are four laws, but the first three are the most commonly discussed and well-known. Let's go through each of them:\r\n1. Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics:\r\nIf two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law establishes the concept of temperature and is the basis for temperature measurement.\r\n2. First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation):\r\nThe total energy of an isolated system is constant. Energy can be transformed from one form to another (e.g., from heat to work), but it cannot be created or destroyed. Mathematically, it is often expressed as:\r\n\u0394\ufffd=\ufffd\u2212\ufffd\u0394U=Q\u2212W\r\nWhere:\r\n\u0394\ufffd\u0394U is the change in internal energy of the system.\r\n\ufffdQ is the heat added to the system.\r\n\ufffdW is the work done by the system.\r\n3. Second Law of Thermodynamics:\r\na. Clausius Statement:\r\nHeat energy will not naturally flow from a colder body to a hotter body. In other words, heat tends to flow from hot to cold.\r\nb. Kelvin-Planck Statement:\r\nIt is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no effect other than the transfer of heat from a lower-temperature body to a higher-temperature body. This statement highlights the impossibility of a perpetual motion machine.\r\n4. Third Law of Thermodynamics:\r\nAs the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero (0\u2009K0K), the entropy of the system approaches a minimum. The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly zero. This law is often stated as \"the entropy of a perfect crystal is zero at absolute zero.\"\r\n\r\nAdd an example after each law to make it easy to understand. Explain \u2018Clausius Statement\u201d with more info.\r\n",

According to reports, a team led by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Atul Kulkarni made the arrests after busting the gang's hideout at Bhayander Road under the limits of the Kashimira Road police station. Pictures accessed by sections of the media show adulterated butter being filled into Amul packaging. At the time of the raid, police seized a staggering 1,000 kilograms of butter along with packaging used by Amul Butter. An investigation has been launched into the case to ascertain how members of the gang got their hands on the packaging used by Amul cooperation. The process of adding unwanted substances to food in a bid to increase profits is known as adulteration. While it is a common practice across the country, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) keeps a tight check on adulterated products infiltrating the market. Milk, tea, coffee, vegetables, dairy products along with wheat and other food grains are the most commonly adulterated products in India as per a report by the Annual Public Laboratory Testing. Food inspectors with the municipal corporation in Gujarat's Surat city busted a gang of miscreants who were allegedly mixing adulterated ingredients to butter and ghee before selling it off as pure to residents in Katargam and Varachh. During the raid which was conducted on December 12, officials seized 25 kg of loose butter and 15 kg of vanaspati ghee from one of the locations while recovering 12 ghee tins of 15 kg each and 48 packs of butter of 1 kg each from the gang's second hideout.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Create summary of it in 3 point. Explain whats noumenon here?\r\nThe rational was the spirit of the civil society. Western civilization is characterized by many attributes; the central attribute is rationality. The modern age in the western counties had its echoes from the age of Mercantilism itself. The age produced luminaries in the field of mathematics, philosophy, geography. Among them, there were many exceptional scholars; one of them was George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Hegel said in the preface of his book \u2018philosophy of right (1821)\u2019 real is rational and the vice versa. This philosopher, whose philosophy is deeply embedded in idealism or in the realm of ideas or consciousness; said man is the child of his times. So, is philosophy. No philosophy is immanent or for all times. The meaning of things is based on a dialectical process, first we observe the apparent, then one presents the opposite consciousness or the antithesis and only then the real appears. Even the real is not real for all times. Real is based on the one hand on reason and on the other hand, dialectical process. The idea of real in ancient philosophy Hegel started the discussion of real with a critique of western ancient philosophy. Plato was on his target but more than him it was Aristotle who said real is that which appears to men or what is the apparent or what is the phenomenon. Everything has two aspects; one which is open to eyes or which appears but there is something behind. Aristotle claimed the thing behind is noumenon. The apparent or the thing which appears is the real. So, this is an essentialist conception of real; i.e., there are certain essential features of the real, which one sees. Hegel opposed this view. He says; no fixed criterion is there for real. It is dynamic; this dynamism can be appreciated by dialectics. Dialectics indicates a synthetic view, a view which has taken the multiple dimensions in to consideration. The dimensions are opposite and contradictory but they synthesize to present a unified view. Hegel criticised the ancient view of reality because that assumes certain features as priori or as essential. Empiricism is based on experienced perception Emmanuel Kant was a major figure in the field of philosophy before Hegel. European philosophical tradition has been to criticise the earlier realms and then propose a new proposition. Hegel criticised not only Plato or Aristotle but Kant too. Kant is the master of categorization but more than that he is an empiricist. Empiric means the experienced reality, the thing we see, we hear or if somebody has collected the experienced reality i.e., empiric. Hegel said this has no substance because which is apparent need not be real. The reality lies beneath the appearance. One can think a couple who are in the market with good clothes may be happy but the reality may be otherwise.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Historians know more about the Mughal dynasty than any other dynasties. One reason is that apart from the royal chronicles, there are a number of independent accounts of their lives and times written by foreign travellers. By the 16th century, India had seen many European travellers, who came here for trade, employment and evangelisation. A large number of them spent time in the Mughal kingdom mainly because it was more prosperous.\r\nOne such traveller was a man named Niccolao Manucci. He was an Italian artilleryman, employed in the services of the Mughal prince Dara Shikoh, who was eventually defeated by his brother Aurangzeb.\r\nAccording to Manucci, he was offered the chance to join Aurangzeb\u2019s army but he decided to flee instead. In his memoir, Storia de Mogor (or Story of the Mughal), Manucci paints a fabulous picture of his life and casts himself as the long-suffering hero and Aurangzeb as the evil villain, his arch-nemesis. But can we believe him blindly?\r\nTime obscures the past from the present; therefore, it is the historians who must squint and puzzle out the blurry events of history. First-hand accounts of travellers provide useful insights into life during an era. But travelogues like the Storia are also often full of completely fabricated details, which makes the job of historians much harder!\r\nConsider Marco Polo, one of the most iconic figures in history, an Italian merchant who visited the Mongol courts and travelled the length and breadth of the Silk Road. He is probably the most famous traveller in history and a common figure in school textbooks. But did you know that when he saw rhinos, he thought they were really ugly unicorns? \r\nNiccolao Manucci was no different. His memoirs are full of factual errors and colourful lies. But through the work of scholars, it\u2019s possible to piece together some key details. Manucci was born in 1638 in Venice and came to India when he was just 17. He landed in Surat and was employed by Dara Shikoh. After Shikoh\u2019s defeat, he worked for the Rajput king Mirza Raja Jai Singh, but this stint too did not last long. Manucci\u2019s travels and quests for employment took him from all over India \u2013 from Kashmir to Bengal, and Goa to Madras (present-day Chennai). \r\nIn the first sentence of third paragraph who is \u201che\u201d referred to?

    "Prompt": "Create a summary with linking between atomistic and mesoscale levels & atomistic scale, where materials are viewed as assemblies of atoms.\r\nCurrently much recognition is being given to an area of computational materials research that has come to be known as multiscale materials modeling [1\u20134]. This is an approach in which theoretical concepts and simulation techniques appropriate to different length (and time) scales are combined with selected experiments to enable a more robust analysis and prediction of certain materials properties and behavior. In this paper, which is primarily tutorial in nature, we examine the contributions that atomistic simulations can make toward realizing the potential of multiscale materials modeling using examples of our current studies of mechanical deformation and thermal conduction in crystalline solids. We begin by noting that among the several powerful drivers of the growing interest in developing computational models of materials performance are the advent of high performance computing, the holistic view of molecular engineering in the development of advanced materials, the emergence of nanoscience and technology, and a number of grand challenge projects such as the ASCI-Dislocation Dynamics initiative at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [5] and the DOE Computational Materials Science Network thrust on grain boundary\u2013dislocation interactions [6]. As the field is evolving, materials modeling has emerged to be a highly multidisciplinary enterprise, emphasizing the value of team research and the exploitation \u0141 Corresponding author: Tel.: C1 (617) 253-3809; Fax: C1 (617) 258-8863; E-mail: syip@mit.edu of complementary skills and expertise among the collaborators. That materials modeling is inherently a multiscale problem is clear to anyone who has considered a certain materials behavior, say mechanical deformation of a solid, in terms of typically four distinct levels of microstructural complexity, the electronic-structure, the atomistic, the mesoscale, and the continuum. At each level there exist corresponding methods of simulation, first-principles quantum mechanical calculations, classical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, finite-element methods, and continuum mechanics (see Fig. 1). Many, though not all, practical applications involve continuum or finite-element calculations that require material-specific parameters or properties obtainable only by atomistic or ab initio cal culations, or derived from experiments. Thus the effective linking of different methods in multiscale modeling is recognized to be a particular challenge, especially the connection between atomistic and the mesoscale levels [7,8]. In the present discussion our interest lies at the atomistic scale where the material system is treated as an assembly of atoms that interact with each other according to interatomic forces derived from prescribed model potential functions [9,10]. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this approach is that one does not a priori specify the mechanism by which the system evolves, or in other words atomistic simulations are capable of revealing the detailed structure and dynamics of interatomic interactions on length scales ranging from clusters of a few atoms to larger units up to the size of the simulation cell. Present practical limitations on system size and simulation time are of the order of a few million atoms and a microsecond, although simulations using much larger number of atoms or running much longer have been made under very special circumstances. It is also well recognized that atomistic simulations depend on the reality of interatomic potential used for their accuracy. As progress is made in developing potential functions which are physically realistic and computationally still tractable, the limitation associated with inadequate potential models becomes less severe, leading to a larger class of materials systems that can be studied by atomistic simulations.\r\n\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Ancient Egypt, civilization in northeastern Africa that dates from the 4th millennium BCE. Its many achievements, preserved in its art and monuments, hold a fascination that continues to grow as archaeological finds expose its secrets. This article focuses on Egypt from its prehistory through its unification under Menes (Narmer) in the 3rd millennium BCE\u2014sometimes used as a reference point for Egypt\u2019s origin\u2014and up to the Islamic conquest in the 7th century CE. For subsequent history through the contemporary period, see Egypt.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to ancient Egyptian civilization\r\nLife in ancient Egypt\r\nAncient Egypt can be thought of as an oasis in the desert of northeastern Africa, dependent on the annual inundation of the Nile River to support its agricultural population. The country\u2019s chief wealth came from the fertile floodplain of the Nile valley, where the river flows between bands of limestone hills, and the Nile delta, in which it fans into several branches north of present-day Cairo. Between the floodplain and the hills is a variable band of low desert that supported a certain amount of game. The Nile was Egypt\u2019s sole transportation artery.\r\n\r\nThe First Cataract at Asw\u0101n, where the riverbed is turned into rapids by a belt of granite, was the country\u2019s only well-defined boundary within a populated area. To the south lay the far less hospitable area of Nubia, in which the river flowed through low sandstone hills that in most regions left only a very narrow strip of cultivable land. Nubia was significant for Egypt\u2019s periodic southward expansion and for access to products from farther south. West of the Nile was the arid Sahara, broken by a chain of oases some 125 to 185 miles (200 to 300 km) from the river and lacking in all other resources except for a few minerals. The eastern desert, between the Nile and the Red Sea, was more important, for it supported a small nomadic population and desert game, contained numerous mineral deposits, including gold, and was the route to the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nTo the northeast was the Isthmus of Suez. It offered the principal route for contact with Sinai, from which came turquoise and possibly copper, and with southwestern Asia, Egypt\u2019s most important area of cultural interaction, from which were received stimuli for technical development and cultivars for crops. Immigrants and ultimately invaders crossed the isthmus into Egypt, attracted by the country\u2019s stability and prosperity. From the late 2nd millennium BCE onward, numerous attacks were made by land and sea along the eastern Mediterranean coast.\r\n\r\nAt first, relatively little cultural contact came by way of the Mediterranean Sea, but from an early date Egypt maintained trading relations with the Lebanese port of Byblos (present-day Jbail). Egypt needed few imports to maintain basic standards of living, but good timber was essential and not available within the country, so it usually was obtained from Lebanon. Minerals such as obsidian and lapis lazuli were imported from as far afield as Anatolia and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nAgriculture centred on the cultivation of cereal crops, chiefly emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). The fertility of the land and general predictability of the inundation ensured very high productivity from a single annual crop. This productivity made it possible to store large surpluses against crop failures and also formed the chief basis of Egyptian wealth, which was, until the creation of the large empires of the 1st millennium BCE, the greatest of any state in the ancient Middle East.\r\n\r\nBasin irrigation was achieved by simple means, and multiple cropping was not feasible until much later times, except perhaps in the lakeside area of Al-Fayy\u016bm. As the river deposited alluvial silt, raising the level of the floodplain, and land was reclaimed from marsh, the area available for cultivation in the Nile valley and delta increased, while pastoralism declined slowly. In addition to grain crops, fruit and vegetables were important, the latter being irrigated year-round in small plots. Fish was also vital to the diet. Papyrus, which grew abundantly in marshes, was gathered wild and in later times was cultivated. It may have been used as a food crop, and it certainly was used to make rope, matting, and sandals. Above all, it provided the characteristic Egyptian writing material, which, with cereals, was the country\u2019s chief export in Late period Egyptian and then Greco-Roman times.\r\n\r\nCattle may have been domesticated in northeastern Africa. The Egyptians kept many as draft animals and for their various products, showing some of the interest in breeds and individuals that is found to this day in the Sudan and eastern Africa. The donkey, which was the principal transport animal (the camel did not become common until Roman times), was probably domesticated in the region. The native Egyptian breed of sheep became extinct in the 2nd millennium BCE and was replaced by an Asiatic breed. Sheep were primarily a source of meat; their wool was rarely used. Goats were more numerous than sheep. Pigs were also raised and eaten. Ducks and geese were kept for food, and many of the vast numbers of wild and migratory birds found in Egypt were hunted and trapped. Desert game, principally various species of antelope and ibex, were hunted by the elite; it was a royal privilege to hunt lions and wild cattle. Pets included dogs, which were also used for hunting, cats, and monkeys. In addition, the Egyptians had a great interest in, and knowledge of, most species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish in their environment.\r\n\r\nMost Egyptians were probably descended from settlers who moved to the Nile valley in prehistoric times, with population increase coming through natural fertility. In various periods there were immigrants from Nubia, Libya, and especially the Middle East. They were historically significant and also may have contributed to population growth, but their numbers are unknown. Most people lived in villages and towns in the Nile valley and delta. Dwellings were normally built of mud brick and have long since disappeared beneath the rising water table or beneath modern town sites, thereby obliterating evidence for settlement patterns. In antiquity, as now, the most favoured location of settlements was on slightly raised ground near the riverbank, where transport and water were easily available and flooding was unlikely. Until the 1st millennium BCE, Egypt was not urbanized to the same extent as Mesopotamia. Instead, a few centres, notably Memphis and Thebes, attracted population and particularly the elite, while the rest of the people were relatively evenly spread over the land. The size of the population has been estimated as having risen from 1 to 1.5 million in the 3rd millennium BCE to perhaps twice that number in the late 2nd millennium and 1st millennium BCE. (Much higher levels of population were reached in Greco-Roman times.)\r\n\r\nNearly all of the people were engaged in agriculture and were probably tied to the land. In theory all the land belonged to the king, although in practice those living on it could not easily be removed and some categories of land could be bought and sold. Land was assigned to high officials to provide them with an income, and most tracts required payment of substantial dues to the state, which had a strong interest in keeping the land in agricultural use. Abandoned land was taken back into state ownership and reassigned for cultivation. The people who lived on and worked the land were not free to leave and were obliged to work it, but they were not slaves; most paid a proportion of their produce to major officials. Free citizens who worked the land on their own behalf did emerge; terms applied to them tended originally to refer to poor people, but these agriculturalists were probably not poor. Slavery was never common, being restricted to captives and foreigners or to people who were forced by poverty or debt to sell themselves into service. Slaves sometimes even married members of their owners\u2019 families, so that in the long term those belonging to households tended to be assimilated into free society. In the New Kingdom (from about 1539 to 1075 BCE), large numbers of captive slaves were acquired by major state institutions or incorporated into the army. Punitive treatment of foreign slaves or of native fugitives from their obligations included forced labour, exile (in, for example, the oases of the western desert), or compulsory enlistment in dangerous mining expeditions. Even nonpunitive employment such as quarrying in the desert was hazardous. The official record of one expedition shows a mortality rate of more than 10 percent.\r\n\r\nJust as the Egyptians optimized agricultural production with simple means, their crafts and techniques, many of which originally came from Asia, were raised to extraordinary levels of perfection. The Egyptians\u2019 most striking technical achievement, massive stone building, also exploited the potential of a centralized state to mobilize a huge labour force, which was made available by efficient agricultural practices. Some of the technical and organizational skills involved were remarkable. The construction of the great pyramids of the 4th dynasty (c. 2575\u2013c. 2465 BCE) has yet to be fully explained and would be a major challenge to this day. This expenditure of skill contrasts with sparse evidence of an essentially neolithic way of living for the rural population of the time, while the use of flint tools persisted even in urban environments at least until the late 2nd millennium BCE. Metal was correspondingly scarce, much of it being used for prestige rather than everyday purposes.\r\n\r\nIn urban and elite contexts, the Egyptian ideal was the nuclear family, but, on the land and even within the central ruling group, there is evidence for extended families. Egyptians were monogamous, and the choice of partners in marriage, for which no formal ceremony or legal sanction is known, did not follow a set pattern. Consanguineous marriage was not practiced during the Dynastic period, except for the occasional marriage of a brother and sister within the royal family, and that practice may have been open only to kings or heirs to the throne. Divorce was in theory easy, but it was costly. Women had a legal status only marginally inferior to that of men. They could own and dispose of property in their own right, and they could initiate divorce and other legal proceedings. They hardly ever held administrative office but increasingly were involved in religious cults as priestesses or \u201cchantresses.\u201d Married women held the title \u201cmistress of the house,\u201d the precise significance of which is unknown. Lower down the social scale, they probably worked on the land as well as in the house.\r\n\r\nThe uneven distribution of wealth, labour, and technology was related to the only partly urban character of society, especially in the 3rd millennium BCE. The country\u2019s resources were not fed into numerous provincial towns but instead were concentrated to great effect around the capital\u2014itself a dispersed string of settlements rather than a city\u2014and focused on the central figure in society, the king. In the 3rd and early 2nd millennia, the elite ideal, expressed in the decoration of private tombs, was manorial and rural. Not until much later did Egyptians develop a more pronouncedly urban character.\r\n\r\nThe king and ideology: administration, art, and writing\r\nIn cosmogonical terms, Egyptian society consisted of a descending hierarchy of the gods, the king, the blessed dead, and humanity (by which was understood chiefly the Egyptians). Of these groups, only the king was single, and hence he was individually more prominent than any of the others. A text that summarizes the king\u2019s role states that he \u201cis on earth for ever and ever, judging mankind and propitiating the gods, and setting order [ma\u02bfat, a central concept] in place of disorder. He gives offerings to the gods and mortuary offerings to the spirits [the blessed dead].\u201d The king was imbued with divine essence, but not in any simple or unqualified sense. His divinity accrued to him from his office and was reaffirmed through rituals, but it was vastly inferior to that of major gods; he was god rather than man by virtue of his potential, which was immeasurably greater than that of any human being. To humanity, he manifested the gods on earth, a conception that was elaborated in a complex web of metaphor and doctrine; less directly, he represented humanity to the gods. The text quoted above also gives great prominence to the dead, who were the object of a cult for the living and who could intervene in human affairs; in many periods the chief visible expenditure and focus of display of nonroyal individuals, as of the king, was on provision for the tomb and the next world. Egyptian kings are commonly called pharaohs, following the usage of the Bible. The term pharaoh, however, is derived from the Egyptian per \u02bfaa (\u201cgreat estate\u201d) and dates to the designation of the royal palace as an institution. This term for palace was used increasingly from about 1400 BCE as a way of referring to the living king; in earlier times it was rare.\r\n\r\nRules of succession to the kingship are poorly understood. The common conception that the heir to the throne had to marry his predecessor\u2019s oldest daughter has been disproved; kingship did not pass through the female line. The choice of queen seems to have been free; often the queen was a close relative of the king, but she also might be unrelated to him. In the New Kingdom, for which evidence is abundant, each king had a queen with distinctive titles, as well as a number of minor wives.\r\n\r\nSons of the chief queen seem to have been the preferred successors to the throne, but other sons could also become king. In many cases the successor was the eldest (surviving) son, and such a pattern of inheritance agrees with more general Egyptian values, but often he was some other relative or was completely unrelated. New Kingdom texts describe, after the event, how kings were appointed heirs either by their predecessors or by divine oracles, and such may have been the pattern when there was no clear successor. Dissent and conflict are suppressed from public sources. From the Late period (664\u2013332 BCE), when sources are more diverse and patterns less rigid, numerous usurpations and interruptions to the succession are known; they probably had many forerunners.\r\n\r\nThe king\u2019s position changed gradually from that of an absolute monarch at the centre of a small ruling group made up mostly of his kin to that of the head of a bureaucratic state\u2014in which his rule was still absolute\u2014based on officeholding and, in theory, on free competition and merit. By the 5th dynasty, fixed institutions had been added to the force of tradition and the regulation of personal contact as brakes on autocracy, but the charismatic and superhuman power of the king remained vital.\r\n\r\nThe elite of administrative officeholders received their positions and commissions from the king, whose general role as judge over humanity they put into effect. They commemorated their own justice and concern for others, especially their inferiors, and recorded their own exploits and ideal conduct of life in inscriptions for others to see. Thus, the position of the elite was affirmed by reference to the king, to their prestige among their peers, and to their conduct toward their subordinates, justifying to some extent the fact that they\u2014and still more the king\u2014appropriated much of the country\u2019s production.\r\n\r\nThese attitudes and their potential dissemination through society counterbalanced inequality, but how far they were accepted cannot be known. The core group of wealthy officeholders numbered at most a few hundred, and the administrative class of minor officials and scribes, most of whom could not afford to leave memorials or inscriptions, perhaps 5,000. With their dependents, these two groups formed perhaps 5 percent of the early population. Monuments and inscriptions commemorated no more than one in a thousand people.\r\n\r\nAccording to royal ideology, the king appointed the elite on the basis of merit, and in ancient conditions of high mortality the elite had to be open to recruits from outside. There was, however, also an ideal that a son should succeed his father. In periods of weak central control this principle predominated, and in the Late period the whole society became more rigid and stratified.\r\n\r\nWriting was a major instrument in the centralization of the Egyptian state and its self-presentation. The two basic types of writing\u2014hieroglyphs, which were used for monuments and display, and the cursive form known as hieratic\u2014were invented at much the same time in late predynastic Egypt (c. 3000 BCE). Writing was chiefly used for administration, and until about 2650 BCE no continuous texts are preserved; the only extant literary texts written before the early Middle Kingdom (c. 1950 BCE) seem to have been lists of important traditional information and possibly medical treatises. The use and potential of writing were restricted both by the rate of literacy, which was probably well below 1 percent, and by expectations of what writing might do. Hieroglyphic writing was publicly identified with Egypt. Perhaps because of this association with a single powerful state, its language, and its culture, Egyptian writing was seldom adapted to write other languages; in this it contrasts with the cuneiform script of the relatively uncentralized, multilingual Mesopotamia. Nonetheless, Egyptian hieroglyphs probably served in the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE as the model from which the alphabet, ultimately the most widespread of all writing systems, evolved.\r\nThe dominant visible legacy of ancient Egypt is in works of architecture and representational art. Until the Middle Kingdom, most of these were mortuary: royal tomb complexes, including pyramids and mortuary temples, and private tombs. There were also temples dedicated to the cult of the gods throughout the country, but most of these were modest structures. From the beginning of the New Kingdom, temples of the gods became the principal monuments; royal palaces and private houses, which are very little known, were less important. Temples and tombs were ideally executed in stone with relief decoration on their walls and were filled with stone and wooden statuary, inscribed and decorated stelae (freestanding small stone monuments), and, in their inner areas, composite works of art in precious materials. The design of the monuments and their decoration dates in essence to the beginning of the historical period and presents an ideal, sanctified cosmos. Little in it is related to the everyday world, and, except in palaces, works of art may have been rare outside temples and tombs. Decoration may record real historical events, rituals, or the official titles and careers of individuals, but its prime significance is the more general assertion of values, and the information presented must be evaluated for its plausibility and compared with other evidence. Some of the events depicted in relief on royal monuments were certainly iconic rather than historically factual.\r\n\r\nThe highly distinctive Egyptian method of rendering nature and artistic style was also a creation of early times and can be seen in most works of Egyptian art. In content, these are hierarchically ordered so that the most important figures, the gods and the king, are shown together, while before the New Kingdom gods seldom occur in the same context as humanity. The decoration of a nonroyal tomb characteristically shows the tomb\u2019s owner with his subordinates, who administer his land and present him with its produce. The tomb owner is also typically depicted hunting in the marshes, a favourite pastime of the elite that may additionally symbolize passage into the next world. The king and the gods are absent in nonroyal tombs, and, until the New Kingdom, overtly religious matter is restricted to rare scenes of mortuary rituals and journeys and to textual formulas. Temple reliefs, in which king and gods occur freely, show the king defeating his enemies, hunting, and especially offering to the gods, who in turn confer benefits upon him. Human beings are present at most as minor figures supporting the king. On both royal and nonroyal monuments, an ideal world is represented in which all are beautiful and everything goes well; only minor figures may have physical imperfections.\r\n\r\nThis artistic presentation of values originated at the same time as writing but before the latter could record continuous texts or complex statements. Some of the earliest continuous texts of the 4th and 5th dynasties show an awareness of an ideal past that the present could only aspire to emulate. A few \u201cbiographies\u201d of officials allude to strife, but more-nuanced discussion occurs first in literary texts of the Middle Kingdom. The texts consist of stories, dialogues, lamentations, and especially instructions on how to live a good life, and they supply a rich commentary on the more one-dimensional rhetoric of public inscriptions. Literary works were written in all the main later phases of the Egyptian language\u2014Middle Egyptian; the \u201cclassical\u201d form of the Middle and New kingdoms, continuing in copies and inscriptions into Roman times; Late Egyptian, from the 19th dynasty to about 700 BCE; and the demotic script from the 4th century BCE to the 3rd century CE\u2014but many of the finest and most complex are among the earliest.\r\n\r\nLiterary works also included treatises on mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and magic, as well as various religious texts and canonical lists that classified the categories of creation (probably the earliest genre, dating back to the beginning of the Old Kingdom, c. 2575 BCE, or even a little earlier). Among these texts, little is truly systematic, a notable exception being a medical treatise on wounds. The absence of systematic inquiry contrasts with Egyptian practical expertise in such fields as surveying, which was used both for orienting and planning buildings to remarkably fine tolerances and for the regular division of fields after the annual inundation of the Nile; the Egyptians also had surveyed and established the dimensions of their entire country by the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. These precise tasks required both knowledge of astronomy and highly ingenious techniques, but they apparently were achieved with little theoretical analysis.\r\n\r\nWhereas in the earliest periods Egypt seems to have been administered almost as the personal estate of the king, by the central Old Kingdom it had been divided into about 35 nomes, or provinces, each with its own officials. Administration was concentrated at the capital, where most of the central elite lived and died. In the nonmonetary Egyptian economy, its essential functions were the collection, storage, and redistribution of produce; the drafting and organization of manpower for specialized labour, probably including irrigation and flood protection works, and major state projects; and the supervision of legal matters. Administration and law were not fully distinct, and both depended ultimately on the king. The settlement of disputes was in part an administrative task, for which the chief guiding criterion was precedent, while contractual relations were regulated by the use of standard formulas. State and temple both partook in redistribution and held massive reserves of grain; temples were economic as well as religious institutions. In periods of decentralization similar functions were exercised by local grandees. Markets had only a minor role, and craftsmen were employees who normally traded only what they produced in their free time. The wealthiest officials escaped this pattern to some extent by receiving their income in the form of land and maintaining large establishments that included their own specialized workers.\r\n\r\nThe essential medium of administration was writing, reinforced by personal authority over the nonliterate 99 percent of the population; texts exhorting the young to be scribes emphasize that the scribe commanded while the rest did the work. Most officials (almost all of whom were men) held several offices and accumulated more as they progressed up a complex ranked hierarchy, at the top of which was the vizier, the chief administrator and judge. The vizier reported to the king, who in theory retained certain powers, such as authority to invoke the death penalty, absolutely.\r\n\r\nBefore the Middle Kingdom, the civil and the military were not sharply distinguished. Military forces consisted of local militias under their own officials and included foreigners, and nonmilitary expeditions to extract minerals from the desert or to transport heavy loads through the country were organized in similar fashion. Until the New Kingdom there was no separate priesthood. Holders of civil office also had priestly titles, and priests had civil titles. Often priesthoods were sinecures: their chief significance was the income they brought. The same was true of the minor civil titles accumulated by high officials. At a lower level, minor priesthoods were held on a rotating basis by \u201claymen\u201d who served every fourth month in temples. State and temple were so closely interconnected that there was no real tension between them before the late New Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSources, calendars, and chronology\r\nFor all but the last century of Egyptian prehistory, whose neolithic and later phases are normally termed \u201cpredynastic,\u201d evidence is exclusively archaeological; later native sources have only mythical allusions to such remote times. The Dynastic period of native Egyptian rulers is generally divided into 30 dynasties, following the Aegyptiaca of the Greco-Egyptian writer Manetho of Sebennytos (early 3rd century BCE), excerpts of which are preserved in the works of later writers. Manetho apparently organized his dynasties by the capital cities from which they ruled, but several of his divisions also reflect political or dynastic changes\u2014that is, changes of the party holding power. He gave the lengths of reign of kings or of entire dynasties and grouped the dynasties into several periods, but, because of textual corruption and a tendency toward inflation, Manetho\u2019s figures cannot be used to reconstruct chronology without supporting evidence and analysis.\r\n\r\nManetho\u2019s prime sources were earlier Egyptian king lists, the organization of which he imitated. The most significant preserved example of a king list is the Turin Papyrus (Turin Canon), a fragmentary document in the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, which originally listed all kings of the 1st through the 17th dynasty, preceded by a mythical dynasty of gods and one of the \u201cspirits, followers of Horus.\u201d Like Manetho\u2019s later work, the Turin document gave reign lengths for individual kings, as well as totals for some dynasties and longer multidynastic periods.\r\n\r\nIn early periods the kings\u2019 years of reign were not consecutively numbered but were named for salient events, and lists were made of the names. More-extensive details were added to the lists for the 4th and 5th dynasties, when dates were assigned according to biennial cattle censuses numbered through each king\u2019s reign. Fragments of such lists are preserved on the Palermo Stone, an inscribed piece of basalt (at the Regional Museum of Archaeology in Palermo, Italy), and related pieces in the Cairo Museum and University College London; these are probably all parts of a single copy of an original document of the 5th dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians did not date by eras longer than the reign of a single king, so a historical framework must be created from totals of reign lengths, which are then related to astronomical data that may allow whole periods to be fixed precisely. This is done through references to astronomical events and correlations with the three calendars in use in Egyptian antiquity. All dating was by a civil calendar, derived from the lunar calendar, which was introduced in the first half of the 3rd millennium BCE. The civil year had 365 days and started in principle when Sirius, or the Dog Star\u2014also known in Greek as Sothis (Ancient Egyptian: Sopdet)\u2014became visible above the horizon after a period of absence, which at that time occurred some weeks before the Nile began to rise for the inundation. Every 4 years the civil year advanced one day in relation to the solar year (with 3651/4 days), and after a cycle of about 1,460 years it would again agree with the solar calendar. Religious ceremonies were organized according to two lunar calendars that had months of 29 or 30 days, with extra, intercalary months every three years or so.\r\n\r\nFive mentions of the rising of Sirius (generally known as Sothic dates) are preserved in texts from the 3rd to the 1st millennium, but by themselves these references cannot yield an absolute chronology. Such a chronology can be computed from larger numbers of lunar dates and cross-checked from solutions for the observations of Sirius. Various chronologies are in use, however, differing by up to 40 years for the 2nd millennium BCE and by more than a century for the beginning of the 1st dynasty. The chronologies offered in most publications up to 1985 have been thrown into some doubt for the Middle and New kingdoms by a restudy of the evidence for the Sothic and especially the lunar dates. For the 1st millennium, dates in the Third Intermediate period are approximate; a supposed fixed year of 945 BCE, based on links with the Bible, turns out to be variable by a number of years. Late period dates (664\u2013332 BCE) are almost completely fixed. Before the 12th dynasty, plausible dates for the 11th can be computed backward, but for earlier times dates are approximate. A total of 955 years for the 1st through the 8th dynasty in the Turin Canon has been used to assign a date of about 3100 BCE for the beginning of the 1st dynasty, but this requires excessive average reign lengths, and an estimate of 2925 BCE is preferable. Radiocarbon and other scientific dating of samples from Egyptian sites have not improved on, or convincingly contested, computed dates. More-recent work on radiocarbon dates from Egypt does, however, yield results encouragingly close to dates computed in the manner described above.\r\n\r\nKing lists and astronomy give only a chronological framework. A vast range of archaeological and inscriptional sources for Egyptian history survive, but none of them were produced with the interpretation of history in mind. No consistent political history of ancient Egypt can be written. The evidence is very unevenly distributed; there are gaps of many decades; and in the 3rd millennium BCE no continuous royal text recording historical events was inscribed. Private biographical inscriptions of all periods from the 5th dynasty (c. 2465\u2013c. 2325 BCE) to the Roman conquest (30 BCE) record individual involvement in events but are seldom concerned with their general significance. Royal inscriptions from the 12th dynasty (1938\u20131756 BCE) to Ptolemaic times aim to present a king\u2019s actions according to an overall conception of \u201chistory,\u201d in which he is the re-creator of the order of the world and the guarantor of its continued stability or its expansion. The goal of his action is to serve not humanity but the gods, while nonroyal individuals may relate their own successes to the king in the first instance and sometimes to the gods. Only in the decentralized intermediate periods did the nonroyal recount internal strife. Kings did not mention dissent in their texts unless it came at the beginning of a reign or a phase of action and was quickly and triumphantly overcome in a reaffirmation of order. Such a schema often dominates the factual content of texts, and it creates a strong bias toward recording foreign affairs, because in official ideology there is no internal dissent after the initial turmoil is over. \u201cHistory\u201d is as much a ritual as a process of events; as a ritual, its protagonists are royal and divine. Only in the Late period did these conventions weaken significantly. Even then, they were retained in full for temple reliefs, where they kept their vitality into Roman times.\r\n\r\nDespite this idealization, the Egyptians were well aware of history, as is clear from their king lists. They divided the past into periods comparable to those used by Egyptologists and evaluated the rulers not only as the founders of epochs but also in terms of their salient exploits or, especially in folklore, their bad qualities. The Demotic Chronicle, a text of the Ptolemaic period, purports to foretell the bad end that would befal",

He used his magic to help, and heal the sick, and wounded of the village, Evrit. Wurrem found it his passion in life to care for others. This made him very different from many other wizards who used their magic to gain power, and control. Wurrem was still young though, and had much to learn. He wanted to make a name for himself by helping the world. But this was difficult to do when he lived in such a small village as Evrit. And so Wurrem had an idea to create a wand for healing. It would be able to heal anything it touches instantly. But making a wand like this was not an easy task. He needed two things. A branch that had to be gifted to him from the trees. This was not too difficult though, for he had helped the trees before.But the second thing Wurrem needed was more of a challenge. A bone taken from a living person. To Get this he used a healing spell and duplicating spell at the same time to remove one of his ribs. This was very hard though to use more than one spell at a time. But once Wurrem had both the branch and the bone, he was able to make the wand. To do this he used magic to mend them together. This was very tedious, but when it was finished it looked like a long spiral. Then he set off on his way.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days on the road. And several people helped. Wurrem was stopped by a group of men. The apparent leader asked him where he was going. Wurrem answered in a cheery voice \u201cI am off to help the world.\u201d The leader (Koled) responded \u201cAlright, then you wouldn\u2019t mind helping us out. Would you?\u201d Wurrem \u201cOh yes absolutely. How can I help.\u201d Koled \u201cHand over your satchel.\u201d Wurrem \u201cI\u2019m sorry you may be confused. I can\u2019t give this to you.\u201d Koled \u201cI didn\u2019t finish. Take off your clothes as well and give them to me.\u201d Wurrem \u201cNo I cannot do that.\u201d Koled \u201cWell I guess we\u2019ll just have to take it then.\u201d The group then proceed to attack Wurrem, with one of them stabbing him in the chest, killing Wurrem.\r\n\r\nWhile going through the satchel they discovered the wand. Though having never seen anything like it they assumed it was some sort of dagger. And so Koled held on to it. They then mounted their horses to ride off. But Koled\u2019s horse wouldn\u2019t move. This was new and infuriated Koled. In a fit of rage he stabbed the wand through the back of the horse's head. The horse reared on his hind legs, throwing Koled to the ground. The wand now stuck in the horse\u2019s head. It healed the horse, sealing it there forever. The immortal horse named Unicorn was stuck with the curse of healing anything it touched.",

They were a humble family struggling to make ends meet, facing the harsh realities of poverty that cast a shadow over their simple lives.\r\nLila's father, a hardworking man with calloused hands, toiled in the fields from dawn to dusk, barely earning enough to feed his family. Lila's mother, a gentle soul with tired eyes, did her best to stretch every coin, turning meagre ingredients into nourishing meals.\r\nDespite their efforts, the weight of poverty pressed heavily on the family. The small, weather-beaten cottage they called home echoed with the sombre whispers of their struggles. Lila, a bright-eyed girl with dreams as vast as the starlit sky, often found herself yearning for a life beyond their meagre existence.\r\nOne day, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting hues of orange and pink across the sky, Lila sat on the worn-out doorstep, gazing at the distant hills. The air was heavy with the scent of hardship, yet Lila's spirit remained unbroken. She envisioned a world where laughter echoed freely, and hunger was but a distant memory.\r\nOne evening, as the family gathered around the flickering flame of a dying candle, Lila shared her dreams with a spark of hope in her eyes. Despite the reality that clung to them like a persistent shadow, her family listened intently, captivated by her vision of a brighter future.\r\nDays turned into weeks, and a subtle change took root within the family. Instead of succumbing to the weight of their poverty, they began to find solace in each other's company. They discovered joy in the simplest of moments\u2014a shared meal, a heartfelt laugh, and the warmth of togetherness.\r\nAs seasons changed and the village transformed, so did Lila's family. Through resilience and unity, they weathered the storms of life with grace. While their pockets may not have been filled with riches, their hearts overflowed with love and gratitude for the richness of family bonds.\r\nAnd so, in the small village where hope once seemed scarce, a family learned that true wealth wasn't measured in coins but in the strength of their spirits and the love they shared. Lila's dreams, once confined by the shackles of poverty, began to take flight, carried by the wings of determination and familial love.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth paragraph introduce a new character named John, who is a friend of Lila, with whom she shares her dream and spend a good time with.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Ukrainians marked the Day of Dignity and Freedom on November 21, continuing a seven-year tradition that seeks to place the country\u2019s 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2014 Euromaidan Revolution in a broader historical context. This might also be something for the international community to consider. While Ukraine\u2019s two people power uprisings are recognized as important milestones in the country\u2019s post-Soviet journey, their impact on the wider region has yet to be fully appreciated.\r\nThis lack of clarity is perhaps understandable. Indeed, few events in modern European history have been subject to quite so much deliberate distortion. Ever since the Euromaidan protest movement first emerged in Kyiv in late November 2013, it has been a favored target of Russian information warfare. For the past seven years, Moscow has promoted false narratives about the uprising in order to undermine its pro-democracy credentials and justify the subsequent Russian invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine.\r\nWhile the legacy of the Euromaidan Revolution has been buried under an avalanche of Kremlin disinformation, the earlier Orange Revolution has been increasingly forgotten. At first glance, the peaceful protests of winter 2004 appear to lack the geopolitical drama of the events which were to unfold one decade later. However, this is deceptive. While independent Ukraine\u2019s first great people power revolution did not lead directly to Russian military aggression or spark any immediate shifts in the European balance of power, it remains a watershed moment that marked the end of the early post-Soviet era and set the stage for the Cold War climate that defines today\u2019s international relations.\r\nTo appreciate the significance of the Orange Revolution, it is important to look beyond the political failures that followed the uprising. The protests of late 2004 initially succeeded in preventing Kremlin-backed candidate Viktor Yanukovych from stealing the Ukrainian presidency and made possible the election of his reformist rival, Viktor Yushchenko. However, Yushchenko soon found himself beset by infighting and was unable to lead Ukraine decisively towards Euro-Atlantic integration during what proved to be a hugely frustrating five-year term in office. This paved the way for Yanukovych to mount an unlikely comeback and win the 2010 presidential election race.\r\nNevertheless, the Ukraine of 2010 was a very different proposition to the country Yanukovych had first sought to rule six years earlier. Thanks to the Orange Revolution, Ukraine\u2019s media landscape was no longer subject to the kind of smothering government censorship that had existed prior to 2004. In its place was a lively if imperfect form of journalistic freedom that reflected the competing interests of the country\u2019s various oligarch clans. Once he became president, Yanukovych was unable to put the genie of a free press back into the bottle. Instead, his attempts to reverse the gains of the Orange Revolution helped spark the 2014 uprising that led directly to his downfall.\r\nThe Orange Revolution also had a profound effect on the way Ukrainians perceived themselves and their national identity. For the first thirteen years of independence, the political, cultural, social, and economic boundaries between Ukraine and Russia had remained blurred. Most people on both sides of the border continued to regard the fates of the two notionally separate countries as inextricably intertwined. This changed dramatically in 2004 when millions of Ukrainians mobilized in defence of free elections.\r\nThe protests served as a national awakening, establishing Ukraine\u2019s democratic credentials and setting the country on a path that diverged sharply from the increasing authoritarianism of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. In the sixteen years since the Orange Revolution, Ukraine has staged eight national votes without ever witnessing a return to the kind of political oppression and rampant vote-rigging that remains routine elsewhere in the former USSR. This success has helped strengthen notions of European identity among Ukrainians and deepened the sense of psychological separation from authoritarian Russia.\r\n\r\nMake 6 points from 5th and 6th para explaining long-term implications of the Orange Revolution on Ukraine's media landscape and the country's national identity.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "The vanishing of the energy barrier at the special aspect ratio implies a complete cancellation among the primary and image interactions, thus allowing unhindered dislocation glide in the pbc simulation cell. Direct atomistic simulations confirm that DE indeed is greatly reduced at a cell geometry close to the predicted c2 c1. For example, at c 1 20111 and c 2 64 101 , simulation gives DE 0.091 meV \u00c5, corresponding to a maximum internal stress of about 0.3 MPa. In contrast, typical stresses applied in mobility simulations are in the range of 10\u20131000 MPa [23]. It may appear that the atomistic results in Fig. 3(b) indicate a significant size dependence. Indeed, a contributing factor could be the higher order (e.g., 1 r) terms in the elastic interactions. On the other hand, it should be noted that the energy scale in this figure is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than typical values for migration barriers for dislocations, so the effect here is rather small. Nevertheless we believe the existence of special geometries, arising from elastic anisotropy, for which DE 0 is quite general, and it is indeed confirmed by our results for a screw dislocation in Mo.

    "Prompt": "On a warm summer evening in Surat, my wife and I were on our way to the grocery store, when I noticed a man sitting on the pavement under a street light. Something about him made me stop. He sat motionless on his haunches, his unwavering gaze fixed on an object only he could see. His beard was long and unkempt, much like the matted hair on his head. A discarded advertisement banner draped crudely around his waist was his only protection from the elements. The vacant look in his eyes indicated he was possibly incapable of normal mental function.\r\nWe tried asking him a few questions, but he showed no signs of having heard or understood us. He just sat there, staring into the darkness, oblivious to our presence. It was quite apparent that he was in need of help and we thought a while about what we could do. \u201cHe looks famished,\u201d my wife remarked, \u201cbut there is no point in giving him money.\u201d I agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s buy him a loaf of bread instead,\u201d I suggested.\r\nIt took us a while to finish our shopping. When we returned to the spot where we had first seen the man, he wasn\u2019t there. We looked around, but there was no sign of him.\r\nDisappointed, we decided to go home, wondering what to do with the loaf of bread. We\u2019d barely gone a hundred meters when we spotted him. Driven by hunger, he had crossed the road and was seated with a family of migrant labourers who had camped there. Surprisingly, none of the family members seemed to mind his presence. In fact, he looked to be quite welcome. The family had accepted him without question, just as they would a visiting relative or a close friend. Curious, I stopped my motorcycle in the shadows and watched.\r\nIt was dinner time and the family had gathered around an open fire over which a lady was roasting rotis on a tava. A dish of steaming rice and a pot of curry completed the menu. The beggar was eating hungrily from an aluminium plate\u2014identical to the ones from which the family partook their meals.\r\nEven as she rolled and roasted more rotis, the lady kept an eye on the stranger, making sure that his plate was not empty. She smiled as she watched him dig into the food clumsily, dropping every other morsel on to his chest and then to the ground. The other members of the family chatted happily as they ate, the rotis disappearing faster than the cheerful lady could make them. These were people who had no roof over their heads, people who were weary from a long day under the torrid summer sun, people who lived from one day to the next in the hope of getting some work and earning a few rupees to keep their tummies from growling. We watched for a while. Then, overcome with guilt, we placed the loaf of bread near the man and rode away, but not before learning the true meaning of giving and sharing. That family was far from wealthy, but they shared what they had, not something they had no use for, or something they could easily afford, like a loaf of bread.\r\n\r\nIdentify If the narrator was feeling positive, negative, sad, disappointed, guilty about the whole incident. \r\n",

    "Prompt": "Act as Albert Einstein and write a letter to Oppen J Heimer about this research and its finding in a grave depressing tone.\r\nPeriodic boundary conditions (pbc) are ubiquitous in describing crystalline states theoretically and computationally, its fundamental appeal being that translational invariance of the infinite crystal is naturally preserved. Where long-range fields are present, whether electrostatic as in Coulomb interaction between charges or elastic as in strain-producing dislocations, one encounters an infinite sum of image interactions which is only conditionally convergent. In the case of dislocations, the problem has been solved by summing dislocation walls for edge dislocations [1\u20133] and performing fast multipole calculations [2] or Ewald-like summations for screw dislocations [4]. However, all the proposed methods are applicable only to isotropic media, leaving the effects of anisotropy without scrutiny. In this Letter we describe a new method for calculating the elastic energy of a periodic array of dislocation dipoles that is applicable to anisotropic media. By finding the reversible work to create a dislocation dipole from a perfect lattice in a periodic simulation cell, we obtain an expression for the elastic interaction that is manifestly absolutely convergent. Comparing the image interactions thus obtained with the infinite summation previously encountered, we show that the problem of conditional convergence arises from the average stress generated by the array of image dipoles, a mean-field-type elastic energy that has been overlooked heretofore. We extract a self-consistent core energy of the shuffle-set screw dislocation in Si from atomistic calculations and demonstrate its invariance to system size effects, a result which would not be obtained if elastic isotropy had been assumed. Furthermore, we show that an optimum simulation cell geometry (aspect ratio) exists for which there is complete cancellation of the elastic interactions, an effect that also does not arise without accounting for crystal anisotropy. Consider an atomistic simulation cell for dislocation core energy calculations that is periodic along c 1, c 2, and c 3 directions, and contains a dislocation dipole with Burgers vector 6b , as shown in Fig. 1. The dislocation lines are parallel to c 3 and are separated from each other by a . The total energy Eatm, in excess of that of the perfect periodic lattice, obtained from a fully relaxed atomistic calculation can be separated into core and elastic contributions [5], Eatm 2Ecore 1 Eprm 1 Eimg , (1) where Ecore is the core energy of each dislocation, Eprm represents the linear elastic interaction between the two dislocations in the primary simulation cell, and Eimg represents the interaction between the primary dipole and all the periodic images. The sums of Eprm and Eimg constitute the elastic interactions, Eel. For the sake of simplicity, we assume c 3 has length unity, so that all the energies are normalized per unit length of dislocation.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Put simply, in 2020, the U.S. Congress passed a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill in response to the economic repercussions of the COVID pandemic. Part of that bill, called the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund, designated money specifically for schools. There are three stages of ESSER fund dispersal that can be used to purchase equipment and supplies, COVID-19 mitigation, or provide support for student needs. \r\nSome of the ESSER funds, specifically ESSER III funds, must be used to address learning loss through evidence-based interventions that respond to students\u2019 academic, social, and emotional needs. And that\u2019s where music and performing arts classrooms can benefit from this funding the most.\r\nThe performing arts support the social and emotional well-being of students, whether through distance learning or in person. Therefore, performing arts\u2013related activities may be eligible for support under this umbrella. ESSER funds are available to schools to make any purchase that will enhance student learning and educational development. In other words, this can include equipment or technology that is often too expensive to be included in a normal year\u2019s budget. Each state has prioritized certain areas of spending, and music education fits into most of these plans.\r\nWhat would make your classroom a more accessible, more enriching environment for your students? You might be surprised at what types of supplies or resources might be available for purchase using ESSER funds. Some examples include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Auxiliary instruments for the band or orchestra\r\n\u2022 Notation or drill writing software\r\n\u2022 Music and instrument storage options\r\n\u2022 Instrument repair and supplies\r\n\u2022 Choral risers\r\n\u2022 General music percussion\r\n\u2022 Movement manipulatives\r\n\u2022 Sound and lighting equipment\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I have a few music stands that wobble if you exhale too hard and a few trombones that are certainly due for an upgrade!\r\n\r\nMake 4 points showing any specific issues with the existing equipment mentioned in the text?

    "Prompt": "Create a YAML template for this theory:\r\nSolid-state theory owes much of its success to constructive uses of the Bloch\u2019s theorem (Kittel 1976). The latter applies to systems that are either naturally periodic or made periodic by replicationof the computational supercell throughout space. The principal advantage of periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for modelling crystal defects is that they eliminate surfaces and preserve translational invariance, the fundamental property of the crystal lattice. However, the advantages of using PBC often come at a price: instead of a single defect of interest, the periodic closure of the system introduces an infinite array of defects whose interaction may distort the computed properties of the defect. The unwanted effects of periodicity can be large for the defects producing long-range fields, such as electrostatic fields of charged defects or elastic fields of lattice dislocations. In order to extract properties of indi vidual defects from the properties of periodic arrays, such spurious contributions should be accurately evaluated. The effects of PBCs are usually considered by embedding the simulation cell in an infinite and periodic array of image supercells that are exact replicas of the primary cell. In this context, the elastic fields of the defect in PBCs can be constructed by superimposing the fields produced by the defect in the primary simulationcell and image fields of its periodic replicas. Similarly, the superfluous image energy can be computed by summing the interaction energies between the primary and image defects. Unfortunately, in some important cases the image sum is only conditionally convergent. The Riemann series theorem states that, by regrouping the terms, it is possible to make such sums converge to an arbitrarily chosen limit (Whittaker and Watson 1958). A similar problem arises in summing electrostatic energy in ionic crystals, known as the Madelung summation (de Leeuw 1980, Smith 1981, Borwein et al. 1985). If such is the case, a straightforward summationusing some na\u0131\u00a8ve grouping of terms will fail to provide a definite answer of the image effect. For the specific case of computing dislocation image energies in PBCs, the existing techniques have been limited to isotropic elasticity or to special dislocation arrangements in the periodic supercell (Gulluoglu et al. 1989, Wang and LeSar 1995, Blase et al. 2000, Ismail-Beigi and Arias 2000). In this paper, we develop a robust method that is applicable to general anisotropic elasticity and arbitrary dislocation configurations in periodic supercells. The method follows from the observation that, when summing the fields produced by an infinite periodic array of sources, conditional convergence and the breaking of periodicity are related. By fixing the latter, the conditional convergent sum is regularized to its physical solution. We then establish a connection between the conditional convergence of image energy and that of the potential field of dislocations. The image energy is regularized by subtracting the non-periodic component of the potential field, which is conveniently carried out by introducing a set of probing \u2018ghost\u2019 dislocations that interact with image dislocations. We present several key applications selected to demonstrate the power and applicability of the method to modelling dislocations in PBCs. \r\n",

It involves fostering a sense of self-worth, confidence, and independence among women, allowing them to pursue their dreams and aspirations without hindrance. This article delves into the significance of women empowerment and explores how it serves as a catalyst for positive change.\r\nEmpowering women involves challenging traditional gender roles. Instead of adhering to predefined roles, women are encouraged to roll with the punches and define their own destinies. This paradigm shift allows them to play an active role in shaping their lives and communities.\r\nJust as a flower needs nourishment to bloom, women need the right environment to flourish. Empowerment provides the necessary \"flour\" for growth, nurturing women's potential and enabling them to blossom in various fields.\r\nWomen often bear the weight of societal expectations. Empowerment encourages them to bare their true selves, shedding societal norms that stifle their individuality and embracing their authentic identities.\r\n\r\nEmpowering women contributes to the creation of a peaceful society. It's not about dividing society into pieces but rather fostering unity and collaboration. Women's empowerment is a key piece in the puzzle of building a harmonious world.\r\nWomen's empowerment changes the scene by altering the way women are seen in society. It challenges stereotypes, ensuring that women are seen not just as caregivers or homemakers but as valuable contributors to every aspect of life.\r\nEmpowering women involves recognizing and acknowledging their strengths as a compliment to society, not just as a mere compliment. By valuing their contributions, we create a harmonious balance that benefits everyone.\r\nEmpowerment acts as a healing force, addressing the wounds inflicted by discrimination and bias. It encourages society to step back from the heel of outdated ideologies, moving towards a more inclusive and equitable future.\r\nThe principal idea behind women's empowerment is rooted in the principles of equality and justice. It's not just a principal's responsibility but a collective effort to uphold these principles and create a society that respects and values all individuals.\r\nEmpowering women is a commitment that remains steadfast, regardless of the weather. It doesn't matter whether societal attitudes are favorable or challenging; the pursuit of gender equality must endure to create lasting change.\r\nWomen empowerment is a multifaceted journey that involves breaking barriers and building bridges. By embracing these homonyms in our discussion, we highlight the nuanced aspects of empowerment, emphasizing its importance in reshaping societal narratives and fostering a world where women can thrive on their terms. As we navigate the complexities of language and meaning, let us also navigate the intricacies of empowering women and creating a more equitable and inclusive future for all.\r\nFind out 8-10 homonyms words from above article.

    "Prompt": "Can you compose a lovely sonnet in this matter where Hegel romanticizes the idea of consciousness - \r\nHegel was an idealist. He said consciousness is the reality. He did not say like Frederic Nietzsche \u2018I think therefore, I am.\u2019 Hegel indicated, idea or consciousness is the real arbiter. Unlike Nietzsche he said matter is not use less. The only thing is idea is primary and matter follows. Marx who became more famous than Hegel, almost altered the whole applecart of Hegel. Marx said matter is primary and consciousness follows. He erected his whole intellectual edifice on the critique of Hegel. Marx took the dialectical methodology from Hegel, he simply replaced it with dialectics in matter. Therefore, Marx declared Hege was standing on his head, I have made him to stand on his legs. It is true and Marx realized \u2018if there wouldn\u2019t have been Hegel, there would have been no Marx. Hegel proposed and popularized the scheme of change rooted in dialectics. Hegel said ideas or consciousness is always in a state of flux. There is always a dominant idea, which is the idea of the age. A new idea emerges from the womb of the dominant idea or thesis. The new idea has the potentiality of defeating the old idea. In its infancy, the new idea or the anti- thesis is weak but gradually it becomes strong and ultimately it defeats the thesis. This clash and dialectics produces, the synthesis. Synthesis is not entirely new; rather it has many elements of the new idea, some elements of the old idea or the thesis and some entirely new ideas which no body had expected beforehand. Reality is also not constant; it changes according to time. Man is the product of his time, so ideas are also product of time. One thing is constant i.e., the basic idea. This basic idea or absolute idea is the monopoly of God. So, reality is also the monopoly of God. Reason is the basis of reality Reason is a central ides is Hegelian philosophy. Hegel gave an entirely new meaning to reason. He said reason is idea reached by dialectical method and logical inferences. Reason in the human realm has its limitations. Absolute reason is the monopoly of perfect spirit and perfect spirit is the monopoly of God. This reason has another bearing in state. The social conditions are moving towards perfect spirit and therefore, towards a perfect state. This movement is also a movement of reality from the immature consciousness to more substantive consciousness. Real is therefore, according to Hegel a dialectical view of things around or encountered by people. Reality has many layers, so the view of reality is always multi-layered. This is something else for people who are powerful at one time. The state is controlled by those who have a better, multi-layered and dialectical view of reality. Rational is real and the real is rational because; in the consciousness of reality, reason is the criterion; in the rational again reason is the criterion. In reality the perception is marked by different layers and which is a dialectical view, a view in which different perceptions are clashing with each other and a dominant perception emerges. In the same manner, in rationality reason is applied or reasoning is applied to the substance. So, both reality and rationality reach the same conclusion.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "In an era where environmental consciousness is paramount, businesses are increasingly recognizing the importance of adopting sustainable practices to reduce their ecological footprint. This is especially true for manufacturing companies, which historically have been associated with resource-intensive processes and environmental degradation. In this article, we will explore how a forward-thinking manufacturing company has embraced sustainable practices to minimize its environmental impact.\r\n\r\nThe Need for Change:\r\nTraditional manufacturing processes have often been criticized for their adverse effects on the environment, including high energy consumption, waste generation, and pollution. The negative impact on natural resources and ecosystems has raised concerns among consumers, investors, and regulatory bodies. In response, some companies are proactively seeking ways to integrate sustainability into their operations.\r\n\r\nKey Sustainable Practices:\r\n\r\nEnergy Efficiency:\r\nOne of the first steps toward sustainability is optimizing energy consumption. The manufacturing company in focus has invested in energy-efficient technologies and equipment. This not only reduces its carbon footprint but also lowers operational costs in the long run. Implementation of smart technologies, such as energy-efficient lighting and machinery, contributes significantly to this effort.\r\n\r\nWaste Reduction and Recycling:\r\nAdopting a circular economy approach, the company has implemented measures to minimize waste generation. This includes recycling materials, reusing resources internally, and adopting eco-friendly packaging. By minimizing waste sent to landfills, the company not only reduces its environmental impact but also contributes to the conservation of natural resources.\r\n\r\nSupply Chain Sustainability:\r\nThe manufacturing company recognizes that sustainability goes beyond its own operations. It actively collaborates with suppliers to ensure that raw materials are sourced responsibly. This includes assessing the environmental impact of suppliers and favoring those who adhere to sustainable practices. The company is committed to creating a supply chain that promotes ethical sourcing and reduces the overall ecological footprint.\r\n\r\nGreen Innovation:\r\nThe company is dedicated to staying at the forefront of green innovation. Research and development efforts are focused on creating environmentally friendly products and processes. By investing in sustainable technologies and exploring alternative materials, the company aims to set new industry standards for eco-friendly manufacturing.\r\n\r\nWater Conservation:\r\nRecognizing the importance of water as a finite resource, the manufacturing company has implemented water-saving measures within its facilities. These include the use of advanced water recycling systems and the adoption of water-efficient manufacturing processes. By reducing water consumption, the company not only minimizes its impact on local water sources but also contributes to global water conservation efforts.\r\n\r\nBenefits and Challenges:\r\nWhile the journey toward sustainability brings about numerous benefits, including enhanced brand reputation, increased customer loyalty, and potential cost savings, it is not without challenges. The initial costs of adopting sustainable practices can be significant, and companies may face resistance from stakeholders accustomed to traditional methods. However, the long-term advantages and the positive impact on the environment make the transition worthwhile.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThe manufacturing company's commitment to sustainability serves as an inspiring example of how businesses can evolve to meet the demands of an environmentally conscious world. By embracing energy efficiency, waste reduction, responsible sourcing, and innovation, this company not only reduces its ecological footprint but also sets a precedent for others in the industry. As more businesses follow suit, the collective impact on the environment can be substantial, ushering in a new era of responsible and sustainable manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd more info into 3rd para and 6th para. In 3rd para talk about more energy efficient products and 6th para talk about importance of eco-friendly products.",

    "Prompt": "Act as Opera singer Aria, create this into a song using biblical language\r\nMother is mother; an old legend in Punjab is, a person\u2019s wife was cruel to the mother -in law. Under the spell of the wife, the man assured his wife, he would present his mother-in law\u2019s heart to her. He killed his mother and took her heart to present it to her beloved wife, as promised. The man fell down on an uneven road, the mother\u2019s heart yelled, are you hurt. In an old movie, two brothers; one a ruffian but rich because of his rogue ways confronts the honest but modest police officer brother. The ruffian asks, I have cars, bungalows what you have. The honest brother says, I have mother on my side. A famous Urdu poet in one of his celebrated couplets said; after the death of my father property was partitioned, I was the youngest, I got mother in my share, I am pleased\r\nMother in literature\r\nWorld literature is full of descriptions of the glories of the mother. The quote which is an ode to motherhood is part of a poem written by William Ross Wallace in 1865. The poem says the woman who is mother is really a person par excellence, be the home; a palace or a hovel, mother is the heroine in her own theatre. Wallace says women is the shield who protects every threat to the home. She protects her children like the hen, feeds them no matter how pitiable are the conditions. Michael Faraday, one out of four poor children to his parents, later recalled; they may be deprived as she was, she always claimed, don\u2019t be concerned, I am here, you will not starve. Very often she slept without food, but she always provided some thing for her children. This has been written by many but in a very lucid way by Charles Ludwig the biographer of Michael Faraday. Probably, the best is Maxim Gorky\u2019s mother. The story is cast in a very different mode. A revolutionary struggle was going on all over Russia. Russians are great story tellers. Gorky writes, if mothers come to share the pain and pathos of the struggling men and women, then the struggle gets the tears and wishes of the mother. They are great inspiring force. The factory men of Russia were greatly inspired by this imaginary mother, who was always there to tend the injured, console the bereaved dependents of a slain labour turned soldier. Bengali writer and nationalist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee in his book \u2018Anandamath\u2019 wrote mother is warrior, mother is protector, mother is the ultimate force to advance the interests of her off springs. He presented the simile of mother for nation and nationhood but in this context; he described the mother of ordinary mortals. He rightly says; mother is the first school; no teacher is better than the mother teacher. No security is better than the mother security.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, the healthcare industry is no exception to the transformative power of digital innovation. One notable example is the recent digital transformation undertaken, a leading healthcare institution committed to providing cutting-edge medical care. This strategic shift towards digitization aims to revolutionize patient care and streamline operational processes, ultimately ensuring a more efficient and patient-centric healthcare experience.\r\nOne of the key pillars of this digital transformation is the implementation of an integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. This state-of-the-art technology consolidates patient information, medical history, and treatment plans into a secure and accessible digital platform. This not only eliminates the need for cumbersome paper records but also enables healthcare professionals to access critical patient data in real-time. This immediate access to information facilitates quicker decision-making and enhances the overall quality of patient care.\r\nTelemedicine has emerged as another vital component of healthcare institution\u2019s digital evolution. The integration of virtual healthcare services allows patients to consult with healthcare professionals remotely, reducing the need for in-person visits for routine check-ups and follow-ups. This not only provides convenience for patients but also helps the hospital optimize its resources, leading to improved operational efficiency.\r\nTo further enhance patient experience, medical instution has introduced mobile applications that empower patients to actively engage in their healthcare journey. These apps enable users to schedule appointments, access their medical records, and receive personalized health information, fostering a more collaborative approach between healthcare providers and patients. The result is a more informed and empowered patient population actively participating in their own well-being.\r\nChange the text into UK english and add an 100 word introduction and 100 words conclusion to it.",

The unique disease and the more unique its rapid spread in the whole world through air planes was investigated very fast. People were dying in score; though a world government is not there but world institutions have developed. They coordinated the whole research related to the medicine or vaccine for Covid19. The second cause is curiosity. Many people wanted to know the taste of cyanide. It was so toxic, people died just after taking it. Then many assembled together to find the taste; they mutually agreed to write a letter before they died. So, by sacrificing their lives, they could find out the taste of the most potent poison of the world. It is sweet. Another instance of curiosity-based research was the search for central Africa. Henry Morton Stanley investigated the interiors of central Africa and found Congo. It was later colonized by Belgium. Columbus wanted to go round the world from the west to east. He was curious, his curiosity led to Europe\u2019s colonization of America. Another motivation for research is coercion. This is nothing new. The small sate in Italy forced Leonardo Vinci to find out poisonous arrows, many rulers of Germany forced scientists to find out weapons of mass destruction. There was more new weapons and weapons in the war periods then in peace times. It is well known, computers first emerged in the weaponry of USA amidst the 2nd world war.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Title: Transforming Healthcare: A Digital Revolution in Patient Care and Operations\r\nIntroduction\r\nIn an era marked by technological advancements, the healthcare industry has witnessed a significant transformation, with hospitals increasingly embracing digital solutions to enhance patient care and streamline operations. This article delves into the journey of a hospital that underwent a digital transformation, exploring the technologies implemented, how the staff adapted to these changes, and the resulting outcomes in terms of patient care and operational efficiency.\r\nTechnologies Implemented\r\nThe hospital embarked on a comprehensive digital transformation journey, incorporating a range of cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize its operations and patient care. Some key technologies included:\r\n1. Electronic Health Records (EHR): The adoption of EHR systems played a pivotal role in consolidating patient information, making it easily accessible to healthcare professionals. This streamlined approach not only improved accuracy in medical documentation but also facilitated faster decision-making.\r\n\r\n2. Telehealth Solutions: The implementation of telehealth solutions enabled the hospital to provide remote consultations, ensuring accessibility to healthcare services for patients, particularly in challenging circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This not only expanded the hospital's reach but also improved patient satisfaction and convenience.\r\n\r\n3. Internet of Things (IoT) in Healthcare: IoT devices, such as smart medical devices and wearables, were integrated into the hospital's infrastructure to monitor patients in real-time. This allowed for proactive healthcare management, early detection of potential issues, and timely interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\r\n\r\n4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Diagnostics: AI-driven diagnostic tools were implemented to enhance the speed and accuracy of medical diagnostics. These technologies, ranging from machine learning algorithms to image recognition software, contributed to quicker and more precise diagnoses, enabling prompt initiation of treatment.\r\n\r\nStaff Adaptation to Changes\r\nThe success of any digital transformation initiative heavily relies on the adaptability of the staff. The hospital recognized the importance of providing comprehensive training programs to ensure a smooth transition. Workshops, online courses, and hands-on training sessions were organized to familiarize healthcare professionals with the new technologies.\r\nOpen communication channels were established to address any concerns or queries raised by the staff during the transition. Regular feedback sessions and continuous support helped build confidence among the workforce, fostering a positive attitude towards the technological changes.\r\nOutcomes in Patient Care and Operational Efficiency\r\nThe implementation of digital solutions yielded significant positive outcomes in both patient care and operational efficiency:\r\n1. Improved Patient Care: The accessibility of EHRs and the integration of IoT devices led to personalized and proactive healthcare. Real-time monitoring allowed for early intervention, reducing the risk of complications and improving overall patient outcomes. Additionally, telehealth solutions increased patient engagement and satisfaction, providing convenient healthcare services.\r\n2. Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Digital transformation streamlined various operational aspects, from appointment scheduling to billing processes. Automation of routine tasks reduced the administrative burden on staff, allowing them to focus more on patient care. The hospital experienced a notable decrease in paperwork, errors, and delays, contributing to overall operational efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake all headings \u201cBold\u201d and sub-headings \u201cItalic & Bold\u201d. Also add conclusion to this article of about 150 words.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "The starting point for the formulation adapted here is the work of Discher and co-workers, although many aspects of the present work depart significantly from the approach outlined in their articles (Discher et al., 1997, 1998; Boey et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1999). They invoked a spectrin-based model that is intermediate between continuum and atomic scales. The approach is particularly modified here to incorporate the effects of random spectrin network, structural relaxation of the in-plane shear energy, and to include the spontaneous curvature of the lipid bilayers material (Helfrich, 1973; Boal, 2002; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2002). The degrees of freedom of the model are the actin vertex coordinates fxng, n21..N, which can move freely in threedimensional Cartesian space according to the generalized force on each vertex. This is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Between a vertex pair (m, n), there can be a spectrin link i21..S whose length is Li [ jxm xnj, the assembly of which forms a two-dimensional network. A vertex triplet (l, m, n), mutually connected by spectrin molecules, forms a triangle a21..P, whose area is Aa \u00bc j( xm xl) 3 ( xn xl)j/2 and center of mass is xa [ (xl 1 xm 1 xn)/3, and whose normal na points toward cell exterior. Two triangles a and b are considered to be adjacent if they share a common spectrin link. In the original model (Discher et al., 1997), the topological connectivities of the vertices are assigned at the start of a simulation and are not changed during deformation, assuming that the spectrin links are unbreakable even at large extensions. This could be a good approximation for some problems but not for others, such as aging and death of the cell where one observes significant changes in network connectivity and order (Liu et al., 2003). To address this issue, we propose in this work a computational procedure whereby network connectivity can be altered. Assuming that the triangles tessellate the surface of one contiguous volume, leaving no significant holes, the total area of the cell can be defined as Atotal [ +a Aa: The total volume of the cell is computed as Vtotal [ +a\u00f0xa na\u00deAa=3; on the basis of the continuum divergence theorem: V \u00bc RR @V\u00f0x n\u00dedA=3; which is a reference-frame independent and numerically robust formula, even when the RBC undergoes a shape change from convex shapes (such as a sphere) to nonconvex shapes (such as discocyte or stomatocyte).\r\n\r\nFind out paper at (Discher et al., 1997, 1998; Boey et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1999) and explain V \u00bc RR @V\u00f0x n\u00dedA=3.\r\n",

One afternoon, all his teachers at Pittsburgh High School met together with him to discuss his case. Paul was late. When he entered the room his teachers sat waiting for him.\r\n\r\nHe was tall for his age and very thin. His clothes were too small for him, but they were clean. He had a bright red flower in the button hole of his black jacket. One of the teachers asked Paul why he had come to the meeting. Paul said politely that he wanted to do better in school. This was a lie. Paul often lied.\r\n\r\nHis teachers began to speak. They had many complaints. One said Paul talked to the other students instead of paying attention to the lessons. Another said Paul always sat in class with his hands covering his eyes. A third teacher said Paul looked out the window instead of looking at her. His teachers attacked him without mercy.\r\n\r\nPaul's eyebrows moved up and down as his teachers spoke. His smile never left his face, but his fingers shook as he touched the flower on his coat. At last the meeting was over. Paul's smile got even wider. He bowed gracefully and left the room.\r\n\r\nHis teachers were angry and confused. The art teacher spoke for all of them when he said there was something about Paul that he didn't understand. \"I don't think he really means to be bad,\" he said. \"There's just something wrong with that boy.\" Then the art teacher remembered one warm afternoon when Paul had fallen asleep in his class. Paul's face was white with thin blue veins under the skin. The boy's face looked tired and lined, like an old man's.

    "Prompt": "Tell me how many kinds of essays is being explained in this text:\r\nTypes of essays: You can easily identify the broad types of essays yourself; because nobody can match the ability of the aspirants to scan the pattern and substance of the essays or anything related to any exams., including the UPSC exams. The broad types we identify are philosophical, analytical, descriptive, issue based or debating and aspirational types. The philosophical are those which do not have a particular topic rather sometimes a quote, a general idea or even a popular phrase. In 2019 essay paper, with the celebrated unpredictability of UPSC, all the four essays in section A were philosophical. I always advise my students to avoid such essays; they fetch less marks as I have gathered from, off the cuff remarks of the examiners. In most cases, it is not possible to avoid them. In the last five years; in 2018 there were five philosophical essays, in 2017 there was only one, in 2016 they didn\u2019t give any, in 2015 there were four philosophical essays and in 2014 there were only two. So, the best approach for philosophical essay is, you have to be prepared to write a philosophical essay. In 2020 there were four philosophical essays in section one, that means you had to compulsorily write one philosophical essay. The tragedy became perpetual in 2021, when they gave all the philosophical essays. These essays were really tough in the sense, they were not easily understandable. The advice I have for you is to read very cursorily on the google about six western philosophers i.e., Plato, Aristotle, Emmanuel Kant, J J Rousseau, Georg Hegel, Karl Marx and Frederic Nietzsche. Don\u2019t go into the details; only basic philosophical ideas. Rest you can do by critiquing them, applying them in India and their present status. In the Indian context go for Gandhi, Ambedkar, Vivekanand, Subhas Bose, Nehru, Tagore and Sardar Patel. You may find them interesting, boring or drab. Do read the book by Ram Chandra Guha \u2018Makers of modern India\u2019. There are books on all of them from the publications division. Those who have the patience; get a book of dictionary of philosophy. Don\u2019t read everything, only basic things for example find idealism, materialism, dialectics, have a look on Freud and his libido. Remember, in essay you write as much as possible. Don\u2019t waste your time in mugging quotations. You know the famous quotations, simply brush them up. Philosophical essays are very often related to values, sometimes to philosophical ethics, very often to administrative pragmatism, the quotes of philosophers; earlier Gandhi and Tagore were in vogue but the trend has changed, now Vivekanand, famous Indian saints, foreign philosophers and statesmen have become more sought after. Prepare from now on, the topics related to pragmatic administrative policies. That popular problematic; if there are two officers, one is honest but inefficient and the other is dishonest but efficient, whom would you prefer, naturally the efficient has to be your choice. Anticipate the philosophical topics after reviewing previous year\u2019s questions. Analytical essays are those which require finding out the real causes, attempts to uncover those aspects of a problem which are generally hidden from the surface. Remember the essay of 2016 on women, roughly it was, if a developmental programme is not engendered, then it is endangered. This is analytical; one has to analyze why gender or women concerns must form part of all development programmes. The western world particularly USA has witnessed a gender revolution; the old way is not acceptable to women in the west.\r\n",

I am not saying this, for the articulate or the experienced veterans. In the first category I keep those who are very organized, who have intellectual back grounds and those who are focused. In the second category I keep those who have learnt it after appearing two or three times in the UPSC (M) examinations. The question is why the majority takes it casually. They have a wrong impression; they can write a good essay in the exam. hall itself. Nobody can help naivety. The reality is essay paper carries 250 marks; roughly 14.28% of the total of mains written exams. Since every single mark matter, one has to give attention, energy and time to get good marks in essay paper. My advice to UPSC aspirants is; don\u2019t assign 2 or 3 months for essay preparations separately, make it round the year practice session. Let me give you some idea of the concept of essay. Essay means presenting something in a whole. Supposing, you are serving somebody a meal, you give him or her one or two chapatis, some rice, some sambhar or pulse, some curd, may be some pickles, some chutney and when he or she has finished the main course, some sweets also. In deciphering this metaphor, in the context of essay writing, this simply means presenting the write up in a planned or in coherent structure. Those who are genius; they need not follow any rules, they can follow their own style of presentation. They can write a story as an essay, a long poem or the whole essay in his or her own unique style. The ordinary mortals must follow some modalities. There are many experts of essay writing in the market, they all have some qualities in them. They might say one thing or two things extra than the other or something less. My discussions with my own students after their exams. and after evaluating their more than six or seven essays, who have got 140 to 161 marks in final examination, I have developed a model structure as follows; first you introduce the topic of the essay in 125 to 150 words, I will come to this later, how you can write this; the next is elaboration i.e. write everything relevant to the topic in 400 to 500 words, then you analyze or dissect the real causes, this may be unpalatable but do write in a moderate way in almost 150 to 200 words, then you suggest or popularly you write the way forward in 150 to 200 words and finally a conclusion in 100 or 125 words\r\n",

The 2019 essay topics; South Asian societies are organized not around states but around their plural cultures and identities, biased media is a real threat to democracy etc. are analytical essays. Descriptive essays are rare; in 2007 probably, there was an essay BPO boom in India. This is a classic example of descriptive essay. In 2019 the essay topic, Neglect of primary health and education are causes for backwardness, the 2017 essay topic Impact of the new economic measures on fiscal ties between states and union of India, the 2016 essay Water disputes between states in federal India and the 2014 essay Tourism: can this be the new big thing, are all examples of descriptive essays. Prepare on the startup boom, the tv series \u2018shark tank India\u2019. The next type can be issue based or debate oriented essays. Remember; the typology I present is not the last word on types and the essay topics, my categorization is not axiomatic. There can be and should be other bases and typologies as well as categorization. The issue-based topics are those which have clear cut two sides, so you have to debate in detail both the sides or multiple sides and after giving the plus and minus of different sides, take a stand in the way forward and give the plus points from your end. There are many examples and every year these topics are asked. In 2019 the topic, Rise of artificial intelligence: threat of jobless future or alternative job opportunities through reskilling or upskilling. In 2017 Fulfillment of new woman in India is a myth are issue based. I say there are some aspirational type essays, the topic can be, 50 gold medals in the Olympic, India as a super power in the next ten years or the quest for 5 trillion economies. Such essays are not imaginative; they have to be attempted in a realistic way. You have to present facts; how the aspirations can be fulfilled, what are the impediments or what can be the potential threats to the aspiration. You must have facts, if you have the facts, you should write. Broad expected areas: The question; can there be a pattern found in expected essay topics or can we say probably, these are the areas from where essay topics are set. I think yes; we can attempt a possible categorization of areas. One such area is women issues; you can definitely expect one essay on women. Note; all women issues are not same; normally what you do is; start writing from the Vedic age, this is wrong. Read the essay topic very carefully and then write. You must remember women in India still value their families more than their careers; there is a report; 21 percent women of the supervisory cadre leave their jobs for the sake of their families. So, the discourse on woman has many shades. Other than women, nothing is certain. The celebrated unpredictability of UPSC as I often say, can be very problematic. You simply scan the essay topics of the last five years, you will realize, how diverse they are. Even then, we can anticipate some of the broad areas; one is economy which includes industry, agriculture, animal husbandry finance etc. Then there is politics, not international politics but national politics; it can be democracy, federalism, media, elections, administrative policies etc. Then is education and health or broadly the social sector. Science and technology are very often popular topics; remember science and technology topics are generally issue based i.e. how these are beneficial or harmful for humanity.\r\n",

Following our honeymoon, Helen and I had set up our first home on the top of Skeldale House. Siegfried, who was no longer my boss but my partner, had offered us free use of these empty rooms on the third storey and we had gratefully accepted; it was makeshift and spartan, but there was an airy charm. \r\n\r\nHelen soon had the kettle boiling in our little kitchen\u2013dining room, and we drank our first cup of tea by the window looking down on the garden. After breakfast, I went downstairs, collected my gear, and headed out for Robert Corner\u2019s farm to treat a foal that had cut its leg.\r\nI hadn\u2019t been there long before I spotted Jock, Mr Corner\u2019s sheepdog and a dedicated car chaser. The farm was at the end of a long track that twisted between stone walls through the gently sloping fields to the road below, and Jock didn\u2019t consider he had done his job properly until he had escorted his chosen vehicle right to the very edge of the property.\r\n\r\nI watched him now as I finished stitching the foal\u2019s leg. He was slinking about, a skinny mass of black and white hair, pretending he was taking no notice of me. But his furtive glances gave him away. He was waiting for his big moment.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until I had started my car and begun to move off that he finally declared his intentions. As I gathered speed he broke into an effortless lope. That sparse frame housed a perfect physical machine, and the slender limbs reached and flew again and again, devouring the stony ground beneath, keeping up with the speeding car with joyful ease.\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp bend about halfway down the road and here Jock sailed over the wall and streaked across the turf, a dark blur against the green. Finally there was the run down to the paved road. My last view of him was of a happy panting face. Clearly he considered it a job well done. \r\nThere was another side to Jock: He was an outstanding performer at the sheepdog trials. Mr Corner could have sold the little animal for a lot of money but couldn\u2019t be persuaded to part with him. Instead, he purchased a scrawny female counterpart of Jock. Soon there were seven fluffy black balls tumbling about the yard. Jock watched indulgently as they tried to follow him in his pursuit of my vehicle, and you could almost see him laughing as they fell over their feet and were left trailing far behind.\r\n\r\nIt happened that I didn\u2019t return to Robert Corner\u2019s farm for about ten months. When I finally saw the pups again they were like seven Jocks darting about the buildings. As I prepared to get into my car they peeped furtively from behind straw bales, slinking with elaborate nonchalance into favourable positions for a quick getaway. \r\n\r\nWhen I revved my engine and shot across the yard, the immediate vicinity erupted in a mass of hairy forms. On either side of me the seven pups pelted along, their faces all wearing the intent, fanatical expression I knew so well. When Jock cleared the wall the pups went with him, and when they entered the home stretch I noticed something different. Jock had always kept his eye on the car\u2014his main opponent. Now he was glancing at the pups on either side as though they were the opposition.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that Jock was in trouble. Superbly fit though he was, those stringy bundles of bone and sinew that he had fathered possessed all his speed plus the energy of youth, and it was taking every shred of his power to keep up with them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was one terrible moment when he stumbled and it seemed that all was lost. But there was a core of steel in Jock. Eyes popping, nostrils dilated, he fought his way through the pack until, by the time I reached the road, he was once more in the lead.\r\nBut it had taken its toll. I slowed down before driving away and looked down at Jock standing with lolling tongue and heaving flanks on the grass verge. Everything in his posture betrayed the mounting apprehension that his days of supremacy were numbered. Just round the corner lay the unthinkable ignominy of being left trailing that litter of young upstarts.\r\n\r\nI felt for the dog, and on my next visit to the farm about two months later I wasn\u2019t looking forward to witnessing Jock\u2019s final, inevitable degradation. But when I drove into the yard I found the place strangely unpopulated. \r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are all your dogs?\u201d I asked Robert Corner.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll gone. There\u2019s a market for good working sheep dogs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve still got Jock?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t part with him. He\u2019s over there.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd so he was, creeping around as of old, pretending he wasn\u2019t watching me. And when I drove away, it was as it used to be, with the little animal running beside the car, but relaxed, enjoying the game, flying effortlessly over the wall and beating the car down to the road with no trouble at all.\r\n\r\nI think I was as relieved as he that he was left alone with his supremacy unchallenged; that he was still top dog.\r\n\r\nMake this a monster stories for kids. Put some suspense elements to it, and add that dog turns into a monster and proceed story on these lines.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "Up till now we have been talking about the theory of essay writing, now I want to tell you the practice of essay writing. I said earlier an essay is a coherent whole; it means the essay should begin with an introduction of the topic and it should end with a conclusion. I said earlier, these two are the most important parts of the essay; most examiners may be relaxed to an extent in other parts but they definitely see the introduction and conclusion very intently. I don\u2019t want to say other parts are not important but intro. and conclusion should be given more care. Introduction should be followed by elaboration, then analysis, then way forward and then conclusion. I don\u2019t say this is the only structure of essay writing, there can be many more but every structure should be integrated. Then the major question how to write an introduction. I give you a clue; you are an anchor in your college programme, you have to invite a participant, you will not call only his name but will say something about the participant, this is what an introduction is. I said in the beginning this should be impressive; should have quotes and some impressive sentences. Sometimes, aspirants are not able to write on their own, copy the introduction of the toppers, you will change them, when you write. The same is true about the conclusion; you have to write the summary in as impressive way as possible, can add quotes and couplets. What I have gathered after examining many thousand copies; you generally write \u2018so; we can say in one paragraph, that there is \u2026\u2019 This style is completely unacceptable. Write, the summary, end with quotes or impressive words, the essay. Supposing, you are not able to write this on your own; copy it from toppers and frame it with your own essay topic.\r\nCreate a 50 word summary for this text and suggest 3 quotes from Freud on this essay.\r\n",

As the heavens open up, a rhythmic dance ensues, orchestrating a melody of nature's own composition. Each raindrop, a tiny conductor, contributes to the symphony that plays out on this wet, enchanting stage.\r\n\r\nThe pitter-patter of rain on rooftops and sidewalks creates a soothing ambiance, a lullaby for the soul. Picture yourself nestled by the window, sipping on a warm cup of tea, as raindrops create a percussive serenade against the windowpane. This is a moment to cherish, a sensory journey punctuated by the gentle cadence of water's descent.\r\n\r\nThe petrichor, that earthy fragrance released when rain kisses the ground, heralds the arrival of a refreshing interlude. It's a scent that captivates, inviting you to inhale deeply and revel in the essence of the rejuvenating rain. With each breath, the atmosphere transforms, transporting you to a realm where nature whispers secrets in the language of droplets.\r\n\r\nWearing a raincoat and wielding an umbrella, one can navigate the streets like a maestro leading an orchestra. Splashes and splatters compose a sidewalk sonata, where pedestrians become participants in the ballet of puddles. The cityscape, adorned with glistening surfaces, reflects the urban poetry written by the collaboration of rain and architecture.\r\n\r\nFor flora and fauna, the rain is a benediction, a six-syllable elixir that breathes life into the landscape. The leaves of trees, like attentive pupils, collect raindrops and release them in a slow-motion dance, sustaining the vibrant ecosystem. A chorus of croaking frogs and chirping crickets harmonizes with the rain's melody, creating a symphony that resonates through the natural world.\r\n\r\nEven in the midst of a downpour, there's a silver lining\u2014a rainbow that emerges, a spectral bridge connecting the heavens and earth. A kaleidoscope of colors arches across the sky, a testament to the transient beauty born from the collaboration of raindrops and sunlight. It's a fleeting yet mesmerizing moment, a visual crescendo in the atmospheric composition.\r\n\r\nSo, on a rainy day, embrace the opportunity to witness nature's grand performance. Let the raindrops be your guide, leading you through a multisensory experience that transcends the mundane. As you navigate the symphony of droplets, remember that each rain-soaked moment is a stanza in the poetry of life, a lyrical celebration of the beauty found in the ordinary yet extraordinary rainfall. \r\n\r\nRewrite this article into a reflective tone acting as a person who is on their deathbed , recounting the love for rains.",

    "Prompt": "Growing numbers of researches have shown that improving the semantic standardization of or adding more structured knowledge into the training corpus would be beneficial to enhance model reasoning capability, either in pre-training or instruction-tuning stages [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. For examples, code languages, characterized by their structured nature and abundant computational logic, would be more conducive to activating the reasoning capabilities of large models compared to natural languages [21, 22]. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts [23, 24] contain more logical descriptions than ordinary text, thus being more effective in stimulating model reasoning ability. Further research reveals that CoT prompts are more effective when the model scale to a certain extent, which can be explained as that a larger model contains more knowledge for reasoning, and the activation of these knowledge requires more logical prompts. To delve deeper into the correlations between code structure and model reasoning, we introduce a study called \u201cProgram of Thoughts\u201d [22]. This research begins by establishing metrics for quantifying the complexity of code structure and code logic. For instance, codes featuring loop operations are considered as having richer computational logic and assigned with higher scores compared to those with mere variable assignment operations. Subsequently, we compile a series of code prompts with different levels of structure or logic scores, and assess their impact on model reasoning performance. Experimental analyses on various benchmarks reveal that the code prompts with higher structure or logic scores are more conducive to improving model reasoning performance. Code language is not suitable to represent common-sense knowledge, while Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are more adept in modeling such type of knowledge. To further explore the influence of knowledge structure on common-sense reasoning, we transform structured knowledge in a KG into corresponding code constructs in a study called KG2Code [25]. For example, we made classes and properties in a KG transformed to corresponding Class and member variable declarations found in conventional object-oriented programming languages. We then use the code-formed KGs as prompts or directly inject them into base model pre-trainings, and evaluate their impact on downstream tasks. Experimental results have indicated that models augmented with code-formed KGs exhibit notable performance improvements in various dimensions, particularly in extraction tasks. External knowledge can also enhance the generalization ability of large models. As discussed in RetroPrompt [26],large models usually rely on \u201cmechanical memorization\u201d to handle long-tailed or isolated samples rather than actually learning underlying patterns. This is one of the essential reasons why many large models have poor generalization ability in few-shot scenarios. It\u2019s like a student who only knows how to memorize things mechanically is relatively weak to extrapolate from one instance to others. RetroPrompt addresses this issue by decoupling knowledge from memory, and train a external knowledge base (not necessarily a KG here) independently. Prompts are then enriched by retrieving pertinent knowledge the pretrained knowledge base. Experiments indicate that RetroPrompt manages to effectively improve the generalization ability of models particularly in few-shot scenarios.\r\n\r\nI want to find how many square brackets [] were used in this text, for the citations. Liekwise tell me the number of times \u2018LLM\u2019 and \u2018Large Language Model\u2019 is used in this text.\r\n",

Take at least 15 minutes to select both the topics. Underline the topics to mark parts of the essay. You have to make rough work, make the rough very brief, in points but should be clear and legible, when you are writing the essays, be articulate, see the rough and write and write carefully. Give relatively less time to the first essay and more time to the second essay. Dos: There are some do\u2019s and some don\u2019t do\u2019s in essay writing. You write in a Sequence and that too logical sequence should be maintained in between the paragraphs i.e. in one paragraph, you write history and connect with the present. Sub-titles should be given and underline them. Give as many charts, diagrams, tables and maps etc. as much is possible. They should be relevant. Give quotes, phrases in the introduction and conclusion, write only those quotes which are relevant. You may remember many, do not write all those you remember. Write cautiously and carefully. Don\u2019t dos: The don\u2019t dos are also important; some people say write in a flow, I say don\u2019t write in a flow, ideas run fast, your hands can not match the flight of ideas, so write carefully. Maintain the structure; begin with the introduction, then go on to elaborate, then analyze, then suggest or way forward and then conclude. A sequence has to be maintained, don\u2019t mix up this structure or sequence. Don\u2019t repeat your arguments and ideas at any cost. Don\u2019t care for your writing and language, they will take their own care in course of time or even if you have bad hand writing the examiners have enough time to decipher them. Don\u2019t give too many quotes or maps or charts, they may disturb the structure. Last words: Remember, no amount of direction, advice works for essay writing. This comes by writing. You join us and we will force you to write before us and we will examine your essay before you. So, why hesitate; start writing now. First write on any topic in 200 words; but mind you, maintain the structure even in 200 words. Then write an essay in 300 word, then gradually go on increasing the word number. Even in your final examination don\u2019t write more than 1000 or 1050 words. Brevity is the best policy, the instruction is don\u2019t write more than 1200 words, no where it is written don\u2019t write in less than so many words. So; ready, get set and go.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "A Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud is scheduled to pronounce on December 11 its judgment on the challenge to the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special privileges to Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nThe case was reserved for verdict on September 5.\r\nThe hearings, which saw submissions made by both petitioners and the government on the constitutionality of the procedure adopted to repeal the Article and the abolition of Statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, had spanned 16 days.\r\nThe government had argued that the abrogation was necessary to completely integrate Jammu and Kashmir into the Union of India. The government said the Valley had prospered in the past four and a half years after the repeal of Article 370 in August 2019. It said elections were due in Jammu and Kashmir, which would revert to full statehood again once the situation on the ground returned to normal.\r\nThe Centre had contended that Jammu and Kashmir became a Union Territory in an \u201cextraordinarily extreme situation\u201d. It claimed that terrorism, infiltration, stone-pelting and casualties among security personnel had reduced by 45.2%, 90.2%, 97.2% and 65.9%, respectively, post the abrogation in 2019.\r\nBrute majority\r\nThe petitioners had said the Union used brute majority in the Parliament and a series of executive orders issued through the President to divide a full-fledged State into the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. They called it an attack on federalism and a fraud played on the Constitution.\r\nThe petitioners had argued that Article 370 had assumed a permanent character as soon as the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly dissolved in 1957 after the framing of the State Constitution. Senior counsel Kapil Sibal said Article 368 (Parliament\u2019s power to amend the Constitution) did not apply to Article 370.\r\nThe Constitution Bench, also comprising Justices S.K. Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant, said its focus would be on the series of machinations which led to the abrogation of Article 370.\r\nThe Bench had looked into a series of events which started with the dissolution of the Jammu and Kashmir State legislative Assembly by the Governor under Section 53(2) of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution on November 21, 2018.\r\nThe proclamation of President\u2019s rule under Article 356 was issued a month later, on December 19, 2018. The Parliament had approved the proclamation of the President on January 3, 2019. The President\u2019s rule was extended for six months with effect from July 3, 2019.\r\nOn August 5, 2019, the President issued the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order which inserted a new provision, Article 367(4), in the Indian Constitution. This replaced the expression \u2018Constituent Assembly of the State\u2019 in the proviso to Article 370(3) with \u2018Legislative Assembly of the State\u2019.\r\nThe same day had seen the Parliament abrogate Article 370 and pass the Bill to reorganise the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The next day saw the President declare that Article 370 has ceased to apply.\r\n\r\nI need some verification here, check the authenticity of this claim: \u2018Article 368 (Parliament\u2019s power to amend the Constitution) did not apply to Article 370\u2019 said by kapil sibbal.\r\n",

The problematic is not only of human wants and aspirations rather it is; what humanity is all about; what a person is born for, what is his mission in life. Many have said; even earlier it was not under his control, religion, the Goliath, has aways decided why a person is born, what is his duty in this life and what one is destined to. The critics say, there were lots of space for the heretics to go astray; establish heretic foundations, even they have formed the sects. Afterall; what Veer Shaiva sect which culminated in Lingayat sect is meant for. What has happened in the last 30 years? All agree the last three decades have been a period of fast changes; now men and women could discuss, next day\u2019s menu with their daughter from any country in the world; one can talk to his employees the world over either on zoom or google talk.

No, it has not happened, rather the contrary has happened. Power is now concentrated in few hands; resources are concentrated even in more fewer hands. Prestige is something subjective.

    "Prompt": "Throughout our lives, we encounter various situations that shape our identity and perspective. We may face triumphs and successes that boost our confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment. Simultaneously, we encounter failures and setbacks that test our resilience and offer valuable lessons for personal development. These experiences collectively contribute to our growth as individuals and shape the unique fabric of our being.\r\n\r\nThe concept of being human extends beyond mere existence as a member of the Homo sapiens species. It encompasses the ideals of compassion, empathy, self-awareness, and moral consciousness. To be human is to embrace our capacity for reason, creativity, and the pursuit of truth and justice. It is a lifelong endeavor to cultivate our humanity and foster a harmonious coexistence with others and the world around us.\r\n\r\nHowever, the path towards being human is not a straightforward one. It is a complex and often arduous journey that requires introspection, self-reflection, and growth. The process of self-evaluation, free from bias and unaffected by personal preferences, is an essential aspect of personal growth regarding being human. Typically, humans have a tendency to prioritize their own ideologies and preferences.\r\n\r\nIndividuals often strive to justify their thoughts and actions, even if they may not align with reality. It is the ego that prevents individuals from acknowledging their shortcomings and falsehoods, hindering their ability to truly accept their weaknesses and lack of understanding. However, the journey towards being human involves acknowledging these limitations and rejecting false notions of self-importance. By embracing humility and recognizing the need for improvement, individuals can transition from human being to being truly human. Generally, an individual spends a significant portion of their lives simply being human, going through the motions without truly understanding or embodying the essence of their humanity. They may be driven by primal instincts, societal expectations, or personal ambitions, losing sight of the fundamental values that define our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nTo embark on the transformative journey from human being to being human, the development of profound self-awareness is paramount. Self-awareness is the inherent ability of the mind to integrate both the external and internal worlds. However, the inclination of the mind is often to align itself with the side that is more convenient for the individual. Nevertheless, an aware mind always takes the side of righteousness, regardless of convenience. Examining our thoughts, emotions, and actions becomes crucial in this process. We must question the motives and consequences behind them. By gaining a better understanding of ourselves, we can effectively identify our strengths and weaknesses, biases and prejudices. This self-examination empowers us to actively personal inner growth and enlightenment.\r\n\r\nHuman beings have the capacity for reason and logical thinking. We can analyze information, solve problems, make decisions based on evidence and critical thinking, and pursue knowledge and understanding.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, being human requires us to cultivate empathy and compassion towards others. It involves recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of every individual, regardless of their background, beliefs, or circumstances. Through empathy, we can transcend our own perspectives and connect with the experiences and emotions of others, fostering understanding and fostering a more inclusive and compassionate society. True humans possess the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. They demonstrate empathy by showing kindness, compassion, and a genuine concern for the well-being of others. They strive to alleviate suffering and promote the welfare of those around them.\r\nAs per the context, does idea of being a human exceeds the concept of being a member of homo sapiens ?\r\n",

Do a sentiment analysis of it and create a speech which uses this passage on justifying the claim.\r\nEverybody is aware of that witty man; Charlie Chaplin. He made a film \u2018Modern Man\u2019 in 1936. The film shows the development of technology; he could easily communicate the message; one should be the master of technology but not the slave of technology. Men have become independent, they say, they can live on their own, they are mistaken, they need a cigarette before they ease themselves, they are waiting for the newspaper before they can go for wash. No, there are rebels, those who will not accept the dictates of the powerful. Michel Foucault, in his discussion of post -modern society said it is very regimental society. It is almost a prison, an asylum where people are under surveillance. They are robots, they have been programmed to think in a designed manner. In the name of democracy; they face the most undemocratic rulers. In the past, the rebel was respected, by rebelling against the social order he became the guide of the society. The moment a society or a group, decided one person is very exceptional, very different, very unique, they called that person a saint or good soul. The tragedy is, in this age of super technology, an exceptional man is very often called mad or derailed, he is not adored but abused. The technological society is not a liberating society.\r\n",

    "Prompt": "The interactions we have with others, might seem to be simple and casual; in reality it involves a complex process of evaluation of the other, one\u2019s reaction to the other, also involves many things like one\u2019s interests, the other party\u2019s power and also what should be the appropriate behaviour towards the other party. The psychologists, the world over have tried to uncover the drives and motivations which go beyond or beneath the apparent. The most interesting thing, Karl Jung said in one\u2019s relations and reactions to others, the individual is telling more about oneself than the other. USA have seen tremendous development in the field of individual or the mind of the individual. The individual matters in entrepreneurship; he has to be agile, innovative, inspiring, intelligent and calculating. That great country of business and industry; USA has been the capital of market economy. The important thing is when the board wants to know about a person, they ask him/her to describe, someone else and the board understands what he or she is capable of. One group of post graduate students were discussing this very phenomenon. The discussion soon turned out to be a running match between those who said \u2018yes\u2019 when a person is describing the other, is basically describing him/herself and the others said, no, when one is describing the other, he is basically describing the other. Group A: You see, Sigmund Freud said, when a person is talking about others, he is doing that according to his/her perception but more important is the person is seeing himself in others. He imagines, the other person must not violate rules, he has limits on the capacity of adventure, he is intelligent but not laborious, he cannot take dangerous risks and if the company demands to pursue more innovative ways to increase sales, he will not do it. Group B: No, everybody realizes the other party is different from him. Freud also said, there is always an \u2018I\u2019 which is the indication of one\u2019s motives, aspirations, desires, wishes and unique dispositions. \u2018Me\u2019 is the significant others or those with whom a person is close but at the same time those he emulates. The others or the society at large is the super ego. He or Freud said in his or her evaluation of the other; all these things matter. Those who say it is just a reflection of one\u2019s own desires, simply is ignoring the role of super ego. In one sense, if \u2018ID\u2019 is the peculiar self of the individual, can one person deny the role of his individual drives and idiosyncracies or individuality. Group A: No matter how much you deny, the imprint of one person of his evaluation of the other is always there. One must remember the very famous psychology experiment about individual cognition, Rorschach test; developed by Hermann Rorschach. In this test; ink blots are provided to individuals selected for the test. We can represent the ink blots to other individuals. These blots are life less symbols, different persons call them different things. The reactions of respondents represent their own self. This test is used to test the personality traits of a person. In the same way; when some one of us, is giving his opinion about others, he is in fact describing him/herself. The group further added the name of George Herbert Mead, the famous Chicago philosopher and psychologist. Mead has been famous for his concept of the Significant Other. Mead said whenever a person meets another person; both of them evaluate each other. The more important thing is, they cognize and react with each other. The same persons when they report to other persons about their meeting, they in fact talk about their own self and not the other. In the same manner if somebody advises somebody else, the frame is the person who is advising and not the other person. Group B: The point you are presenting; seems to be appropriate but don\u2019t you think, it is a question of perception. My perception of you, all cannot be about me, there has to be something of the perceived person. Yes, all perceptions are subjective perceptions but is there no truth in the perception about the other.\r\nHere does Group B challenge the idea that describing others is solely a reflection of one's own desires, bringing in the role of super ego and Freud's concepts of 'I,' 'Me,' and 'Super Ego'?\r\n",

By August, the dancing epidemic had claimed as many as 400 victims. With no other explanation for the phenomenon, local physicians blamed it on \u201chot blood\u201d and suggested the afflicted simply gyrate the fever away.\r\n\r\nA stage was constructed and professional dancers were brought in. The town even hired a band to provide backing music, but it wasn\u2019t long before the marathon started to take its toll. Many dancers collapsed from sheer exhaustion. Some even died from strokes and heart attacks. The strange episode didn\u2019t end until September, when the dancers were whisked away to a mountaintop shrine to pray for absolution.\r\n\r\nThe Strasbourg dancing plague might sound like the stuff of legend, but it\u2019s well documented in 16th-century historical records. It\u2019s also not the only known incident of its kind. Similar manias took place in Switzerland, Germany and Holland, though few were as large\u2014or deadly\u2014as the one triggered in 1518.\r\n\r\nWhat could have led people to dance themselves to death?\r\n\r\nAccording to historian John Waller, the explanation most likely concerns St. Vitus, a Catholic saint who pious 16th-century Europeans believed had the power to curse people with a dancing plague. When combined with the horrors of disease and famine, both of which were tearing through Strasbourg in 1518, the St. Vitus superstition may have triggered a stress-induced hysteria that took hold of much of the city.\r\n\r\nOther theories have suggested the dancers were members of a religious cult, or even that they accidentally ingested ergot, a toxic mold that grows on damp rye and produces spasms and hallucinations.\r\n\r\nis it true according to this articl",

Mobilizing members collectively and standing firm against attacks on critical policy agendas require strong determination and unity. As history has shown, when people come together with a shared purpose, extraordinary results can be achieved.\r\nCourage is the ability to confront difficulties and take action even in the face of adversity or opposition. It means having the strength to stand up for what is right, even if it is unpopular or difficult. Leadership, on the other hand, involves guiding and inspiring others towards a common goal, fostering teamwork, and making tough decisions when needed.\r\nIn times of crisis or when advocating for important policy changes, courage and leadership are especially vital. They provide the backbone for a group or organization to remain resolute and persistent in pursuing their objectives despite challenges or opposition.\r\nIt is important to recognize that maintaining a strong resolve in the face of opposition is not always easy. Doubts and pressures may arise, but it is during these times that courageous leaders can motivate others and keep the group focused on their shared mission.\r\nBy combining courage with effective leadership, groups can make significant progress towards achieving their policy agenda, even in the face of adversity. It requires a commitment to staying true to the organization's values and objectives, as well as an ability to adapt to changing circumstances while remaining firm in the pursuit of the overall goal.\r\nAs the world continues to evolve and new challenges emerge, the need for courageous leaders who can rally their members and remain steadfast in their policy agenda remains as crucial as ever.

Discuss basic info like the release date, platforms, and Lucia's potential voice actor. Get insights from gaming experts and trends. End by talking about GTA's impact on gaming culture. \r\n\r\nHere is some info: The eagerly awaited trailer for the sixth installment of the Grand Theft Auto series was unexpectedly released by developer Rockstar, 15 hours ahead of its scheduled launch, following the circulation of a low-quality copy online. The 90-second teaser confirmed that the game will be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and will feature a female protagonist named Lucia, marking the return of a female lead for the first time since the 1990s. Despite the excitement generated by the trailer, fans will have to endure a longer wait, as the game is not slated for release until 2025. This latest installment follows the monumental success of GTA V in 2013, which became the second best-selling video game of all time, trailing only Minecraft. The announcement of the upcoming trailer had already sparked global headlines in November, highlighting the immense anticipation surrounding GTA VI. The teaser showcases various scenes, including car races, boat parties, and a man pulling an alligator from a swimming pool, all set to the Americana sounds of Tom Petty's \"Love is a Long Road.\" Gamers online, expressed their intrigue as a fan who typically streams multiplayer RPGs. They noted the historical male-centric nature of the series but believes that Lucia's inclusion will have a significant impact, potentially influencing other game developers to feature more female protagonists. However, several questions remain unanswered, including the supported gaming platforms. While the trailer did not disclose this information, Take-Two Interactive, the game's publisher, has confirmed that GTA VI will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X upon its 2025 release. Details about the release date and a potential PC version are still pending, with previous games in the series following a pattern of PC releases several months after the console launch. Fans are also curious about the voice actor for Lucia, as the trailer did not reveal this information. The secrecy surrounding the game's development may be attributed to the overwhelming success of GTA V, which sold 190 million copies worldwide and continues to thrive through GTA Online. James Binns, chairman of gaming media firm Network N, emphasized the epic scale of the upcoming game, highlighting the substantial investment of over a billion dollars. The December release of the trailer was strategically timed to coincide with the franchise's 25th anniversary. Originally developed in Dundee in 1997 by DMA Design, later known as Rockstar North, the Grand Theft Auto series has achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success, though not without controversy. The first game's violent content even led to questions in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n",

According to Einstein's field equations, mass and energy induce curvature in the fabric of spacetime, and photons traversing this warped geometry experience a deviation from their otherwise rectilinear trajectory. The degree of light deflection is quantified by the Einstein deflection angle, denoted as \u03b1, which is inversely proportional to the impact parameter and directly related to the mass distribution along the photon's trajectory. Moreover, gravitational lensing manifests in diverse forms such as weak, strong, and micro lensing, each delineating the gravitational influence on light at varying scales. The Schwarzschild metric, portraying the gravitational field around a non-rotating spherical mass, serves as a cornerstone in elucidating the bending of light near massive celestial bodies. Furthermore, the intrinsic connection between gravitational lensing and dark matter distribution in the cosmos underscores the pivotal role of this phenomenon as a gravitational probe, unraveling the enigmatic constituents of the universe and offering insights into the intricate dance of matter and light on cosmic scales.\"\r\n\r\nSummarize the above complicated para in a simplified way in 7 lines highlighting the important aspects without using words that wouldn't be normally found in a 15 year old's vocabulary like General Relativity or Schwarzschild metric",

What you watch is not the point; the object is not the point. The quality of observation, the quality of being aware and alert \u2013 that\u2019s what meditation is. Remember one thing; meditation means awareness. Whatsoever you do with awareness is meditation. Action is not the question, but the quality that you bring to your action is. Walking can be a meditation if you walk alert. Sitting can be a meditation if you sit alert. Listening to the birds can be a meditation if you listen with awareness. Just listening to the inner voice of your mind can be a meditation if you remain alert and watchful. The whole point is one should not move in sleep. Then whatever you do is meditation.\r\n\r\nThe first step in awareness is to be very watchful of your body. Slowly, one becomes alert about each gesture, and each movement. And as you become aware, a miracle starts happening; many things that you used to do before simply disappear; your body becomes more relaxed, your body becomes more attuned. A deep peace starts prevailing even in your body; subtle music pulsates in your body. Then, start becoming aware of your thoughts; the same has to be done with emotions; you will be surprised at what goes on inside you. If you write down whatever is going on at any moment, you are in for a great surprise. You will not believe that this is what is going on inside you. And ten minutes later, read it \u2013 you will see a mad mind inside! Because we are not aware, this whole madness goes on running like an undercurrent. It affects whatsoever you are doing; it affects everything. And the sum total of it is going to be your life! So this madman has to be changed. And the miracle of awareness is that you need not do anything except just become aware. The very phenomenon of watching it changes it. Slowly the madman disappears, and slowly the thoughts start falling into a certain pattern; their chaos is no more; they become more of the cosmos. And then again, a deeper peace prevails. And when your body and your mind are at peace, you will see that they are attuned to each other, too; there is a bridge. Now they are not running in different directions; they are not riding different horses. For the first time, there is an accord, and that accord helps immensely to work on the third step, which is becoming aware of your feelings, emotions, and moods. That is the subtlest layer and the most difficult, but if you can be aware of the thoughts, then it is just one more step. A little more intense awareness is needed, and you start reflecting on your moods, your emotions and your feelings. Once you are aware of all these three, they all become joined into one phenomenon. And when all these three are one, functioning together perfectly, humming together, you can feel the music of all the three; they have become an orchestra \u2013 then the fourth happens, which you cannot do. It happens on accord. It is a gift from the whole; it is a reward for those who have done these three. And the fourth is the ultimate awareness that makes one awakened. One becomes aware of one\u2019s awareness \u2013 that is the fourth. That makes a Buddha awakened. And only in that awakening does one come to know what bliss is. The body knows pleasure, the mind knows happiness, the heart knows joy, and the fourth knows bliss. Bliss is the goal of sannyas, of being a seeker, and awareness is the path towards it.\r\n\r\nThe important thing is that you are watchful, that you have not forgotten to watch, that you are watching\u2026\u2026\u2026watching\u2026\u2026watching. Slowly as the watcher becomes more and more solid, stable, and unwavering, a transformation happens. The things that you were watching disappeared. For the first time, the watcher itself becomes watched, and the observer itself becomes observed. You have come home.",

It was thicker. The trees had grown taller. The ti plants shaded the green forest a sinister red. There was no doubt about it- the jungle was more dangerous here, and Gemma loved it. As a baby, Gemma\u2019s parents had taken her on their expeditions over mountains, deserts, and vast seas. It was exciting, unpredictable, and deeply irresponsible. Now that they had settled down in the tropical rainforest, Gemma had to devise intricate plans just to sneak out for morning adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis particular plan hinged on the help of Milo, her ring-tailed lemur. Years of mischief, tom-foolery, and Gemma\u2019s influence had helped Milo develop skills that other lemurs would give theirs rings to have themselves, were such a transaction to be made possible. And on this morning, Milo was lying in Gemma\u2019s bed, wearing a wig made of straw, the same sandy blonde color as Gemma\u2019s hair, snoring loudly. In a stroke of genius, they had even braided it into pigtails to match her style. They tried adding a pair of her old glasses but those kept sliding down his face, given that she had a human-sized head, and his was irreparably lemur-sized.\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear, her snoring is getting worse and worse,\u201d said Gemma\u2019s dad from the breakfast table, sipping on a warm tea.\r\n\r\nGemma\u2019s mom raised an eyebrow from across her book.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even sound human!\u201d he continued.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating a little, don\u2019t you think, dear?\u201d Gemma\u2019s mom said. \r\n\r\nBut he was not. And had either of them walked one room over to check on their daughter, they may have shouted, and woken up a little, groggy primate with straw pigtails. \r\n\r\n\r\nA short walk away, Gemma brushed past a prickly bush and followed a small break in the twisted liana vines. She came to a wall of leaves and grew excited at the sound of movement ahead. She often felt like she could sense when adventure was near. In fact, she felt it almost every single day, and for the past year, she had been wrong roughly every single time. So, despite the eagerness to find something remarkable, her shock was genuine when she brushed the leaves aside. In a small clearing, no larger than a rock pond, was a black jaguar. \r\n\r\nShe bravely, confidently, froze.\r\n\r\nAs she rubbed the condensation from her glasses, Gemma spotted a small mammal underneath the jaguar\u2019s paw. Further rubbing led to further clarity, and she recognized the animal as a golden mole. Both rare and beautiful. A fear rushed in that, if she didn\u2019t act soon, the mole would be eaten or crushed under the jaguar\u2019s leg.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, Bramblerot!\u201d she whispered.\r\n\r\nHalf thinking, half not-at-all-thinking, Gemma reached into the brown satchel at her waist and found a small piece of suede. Wrapped tightly inside was her favorite brass bell. It was a dented, old gift from an even older grandma, and Gemma never left it behind when she ventured out. Normally, she reserved for it occasions that required making a lot of noise, but an emergency like this called for something much more risky.\r\n\r\nStepping forward stealthily, Gemma used her other hand to free a thin purple ribbon from her hair, turning her pigtails into a pigtail. She pressed the suede against the bell tightly to make sure that it didn\u2019t attract any unwanted attention. A few paces ahead, and completely unaware of Gemma, the jaguar lifted his paw up for just a moment then pinned the mole down again. Gemma allowed herself a quick and disapproving scowl then focused on the task at hand. She opened the cloth and tied the ribbon around an opening in the brass bell. Then, with the delicacy of a snowflake on a silk napkin at afternoon tea with the Queen, Gemma tied the other end of the ribbon in another knot.\r\n\r\nShe slid backwards through the leaves and grabbed the closest suitable rock. As the jaguar leaned down with his teeth bared, Gemma tossed it towards the dense jungle to her left. \r\n\r\nWithout a moment to spare, the jaguar lifted his head, and whipped his body around.\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s when he heard a jingle. A strange, suspiciously close, jingle. \r\n\r\nHe whipped back the other way and heard the jingle again, but all he saw was jungle. He tried prowling around the clearing, looking for the source, but again saw only jungle. The jingles came faster, one after the other. The mole looked on in surprise as the frustration grew. Then, in the type of overreaction that jaguars are known for, he leapt into the deep brush next to him, looking for anything to attack.\r\n\r\nGemma immediately rushed in to grab the wounded golden mole and quickly hid behind the nearest tree. The jaguar ran back into the clearing and looked around with a vicious stare. As soon as he took another step, the bell, which Gemma had fastened securely to his tail, jingled again. Having lost his target, and plagued by the mysterious jingle, the jaguar picked a direction, almost at random, and charged deep into the dark tropical rainforest. When the jingles finally grew quiet, Gemma laid the golden mole down.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s gone,\u201d she said, petting its head softly. \u201cAnd he won\u2019t be sneaking up on anyone for a while,\u201d she added with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe mole wheezed out a tiny giggle then shook out its fur. It looked up at Gemma for a long moment, then scrunched its nose. Without a sound, it dug a hole in the soft earth and dove down.\r\n\r\nGemma watched in awe as it worked its way out of sight at impressive speed. She peered down to catch one last glimpse, but its little feet had disappeared in a flurry of dirt and dust. Gemma looked around. She had maybe ten minutes before her parents would try to wake her up and then find her missing. It was time to head back. Besides, she had found more than enough adventure for one day. Best for her to leave some for the other young explorers out there. \r\n\r\nCarefully listening for the jingle of her favorite bell, Gemma weaved through the thick brush until it loosened and gave way to the path that she had personally made, stomp by stomp, over the better part of a year. She was almost to the hut when a small patch of dirt a few steps ahead of her started to move and shake. Approaching slowly, she leaned down and saw the furry face of the golden mole pop up to greet her. It scurried out of its hole and looked Gemma up and down. Gemma waved hello instinctively, as a matter of manners, and with no idea what else to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mole reached into the dirt, pulling out an instrument that Gemma had seen many times before. It was a dark blue compass, set on a weathered chain. Gemma grabbed it with two curious hands, turning it over and around to inspect. The compass itself was older than her bell, she imagined, and built with much greater care. Then she reminded herself that her bell was now a jaguar accessory, and no longer hers at all. By the time she was done thinking, the mole had hopped back down its hole, leaving the compass behind. Gemma decided then and there that golden moles were strange creatures with strange habits. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that this was an unfair generalization and would only serve her poorly.\r\n\r\nLater that day, Gemma sat at the kitchen table and watched her parents rush around the hut.\r\n\r\nThe compass was hanging around her neck, unnoticed. She had never seen them so animated as they gathered their belongings and shouted out questions and commands to each other. It was on this day that they had revealed they\u2019d be going away on a trip of indeterminate length. Without her. Milo looked up at Gemma and cocked his head to the side. She patted her shoulder, the signal that it was okay for him to climb up and sit. Deftly, he swung up her torso and rested. Most times he would wrap only his tail around her neck, but today was different. He hugged her whole head with every limb he had. \r\n\r\n\u201cGemma,\u201d said her Mom. \u201cCome and take a walk with me to the waterfall. I have something to tell you.\u201d",
